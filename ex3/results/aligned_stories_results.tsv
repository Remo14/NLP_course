After one of the names was called, a great amount of whooping and hooting was heard from a few rows behind us.
I leaned over to my friend and said, ""They sound like a bunch of monkeys!
"" Of course the family causing the ruckus turned out to be black.

1	"A little backstory- I'm from TX.
The chupacabra legend is pretty big here and in Mexico.
I'm a big fan of cryptids so I always liked to think of chupacabra as a creature whose territory covered huge portions of both Mexico and TX.
(I put way too much thought into imaginary creatures)

I was working on the school newspaper and we did a halloween back page with different scary legendary creatures with a silly quip to go with each of them like ""The fearsome were-coyote steals chickens every full moon!"".
I, completely not thinking, suggested for chupacabra ""Chupacabra opposes immigration reform.
"" 

In my head it made perfect sense because building a wall on the border would essentially cut his home in half.
I wasn't even thinking about real people (which was pretty thoughtless and ethnocentric anyway, I admit.
) But I felt terrible because some of my Latino classmates were offended.
I wish I could have had a chance to explain that I didn't mean for it to sound that way, that I just forget that nobody else knows about the mythology I make up in my head.

2	"My friend showed me this drinking game called Tourette's.
It involves a normal deck of cards and two players.
The top card is flipped, and whatever first letter the card name starts with, you have to shout out a random word that starts with the same letter.
For example, a three shows up.
If you don't yell ""TIGERS"" first, you lose and you drink.
I flipped a nine and loudly and quickly yelled NIGGER with the biggest smile on my face because I won!

The word ""nigai"" means bitter in Japanese.
But when you drink or eat something bitter you usually shout in surprise and say ""nigga"" because the i sound is often omitted just because it's easier.
So friend is sitting at a coffee shop and there are black people at the table beside.
He sits down with his friends and sips his drink then yells nigga.
The man at the table next to him turns and kind of laughs, but he realizes what he's done (since that word is very famous thanks to hip hop music) and feels the need to explain.
With his very poor English he tries to explain that he was given the wrong drink and didn't like it.
What came out was ""I hate brack.

8	"There's a bar at the end of my street, and my mom liked to go there to watch people play pool.
She didn't drink, she would just sit there and watch and drink Diet Coke.
Apparently, she struck up a conversation with one of the guys one day, and he kissed her on the cheek and then played a great game of pool.
So after that, he'd kiss her on the cheek before he played pool.
For some reason, the guy who ran the bar accused my mom of being a prostitute and banned her from the bar.
Mind you, my mom was a sweet, 300lb 50 year old lady who worked as an engineer and dressed like she was going to work.
There was nothing about her that would make you think ""prostitute"".
I got revenge there several times.
My go-to was making big pizza orders and then never going to pick them up.
One time, my friends and I went to that bar, and my friend whipped his dick out and pissed all over their bar and floor.
On a Friday night with the place nearly packed.
My favorite though was this one Saturday night...on Saturdays, they had biker night, the place was packed, and they always had the jukebox blaring.
I put a $10 bill in the jukebox and played NSync's ""I Want It That Way"" 40 times in a row.
When I was in college, I was on a road trip and I saw a Canadian bar chain with the same name and logo.
I looked it up when I got home, and sure enough that bar chain had been in business for longer than the bar had been using that name and logo in the US.
So I emailed the chain with pictures of the bar and all the info for the bar.
They emailed me back to thank me and forwarded it to the legal department.
Six months later, the bar had a new owner and a new name.

10	"I used to work at Best Buy in Geek Squad and usually the people working the closing shifts had to clean up their departments and such.
We had just gotten a new manager who was an outside hire from Circuit City.
He was trying to be a hardass and flex his management powers by being a meticulous cunt about cleaning during closing duties asking shit like ""Did you clean UNDER the registers and Windex and dust etc"" about every little fucking thing.
A buddy of mine I was working with and I started our closing duties a little early since the store was pretty dead that night in order to be able to leave at a reasonable hour.
We pretty much wrapped up 15 minutes after the store closed so we got the manager to do a walkthrough so we could leave.
He's looking around and everything seems to be in order until he looks behind some signage on a shelf and runs his finger through picking up some dust.
He has this shit eating grin on his face and lets out a little weasely laugh and says ""Looks like you guys still have some work to do.
"" My buddy and I looked at eachother and we both just knew what had to be done.
We cleaned the entire department top to bottom, inside and out.
Every drawer was emptied, dusted, wiped down, brochures organized.
Every computer in the back was moved and the shelves were dusted and wiped, floors were vacuumed twice, top stock was neatly arranged, every inch of the department was gone over with a fine tooth comb, twice in some spots just to take longer.
10pm turned into midnight, everyone else was long gone except for us 3.
He was looking weary and tired.
Midnight turned into 2am and we were still going at it when he finally came out of the office red eyed and exhausted and said ""Guys, let's go.
"" ""But we still haven't dusted under the counters and..."" ""Its fine, lets go.
"" Buddy and I took our sweet time gathering our things and clocking out.
We both were also off the next day and cunt manager had to be in early for a conference call so it made it all that much better.
Every time he was the closing manager after that night he never gave us trouble again, simply asking us if we were ready to go when the store closed.
Justice prevails.

16	"I remember this in hindsight.
At 21 I was dating with and living with a 20 year old who had two parents who were involved in healthcare.
We worked in healthcare.
It was her ultimate goal to be an OB/GYN.
She studied the vagina, birth, and women's health even before she was done with her bachelors.
She had been diagnosed with irregular periods ages before we started dating.
She was also on birth control.
That didn't stop her from taking a home pregnancy test every time her period was one or two days off.
I once not so jokingly told her that if we had Native American names hers would be ""Pees on Sticks"".
She was obsessed with the idea that her BC wasn't working and I had knocked her up.
She was obsessed with taking a home pregnancy test at least once every month to two months.
Warning this part is NSFW/NSFL:
Then one month she had a really horrible period where she passed a bunch of lining and bled a ton.
Any girl who has really bad periods knows that when they pass a bunch of uterine lining during their period its pretty nasty.
She insisted that she had just miscarried our unborn child.
Refused to take a pregnancy test to confirm.
Refused to acknowledge the fact that she had her period last month and if she had miscarried the zygote would be so tiny she would never notice (mind you, her parents were both RNs and she read and watched everything about pregnancy and childbirth she could get her hands on).
Refused to go to the doctor to get a blood test.
(Most times when you miscarry there is enough HCG in the blood or urine that a pregnancy test ends up positive still.
)

So this girl who was absolutely obsessed with taking the home pee tests to the point we could have had stock in EPT refused to take a home pregnancy test.
At all.
Nope.
She insisted she had miscarried.
So she started mourning.
Told her parents she had miscarried.
Told all our mutual friends she had miscarried.
And then made me feel bad because I didn't grieve.
She even named her period lining (a male name, because she knew it would have been a boy) and bought a special miscarriage remembrance necklace from some vendor online, so she could always wear it and never forget her poor miscarried uterine lining.

20	"I've posted this before but it fits this question pretty well.
I think I was around 18 years old, we'd been dating for about 8 months and I broke up with him because my parents were treating me differently and I didn't like it.
It put too much strain on both my bf and I, and my parents and I's relationship and I couldn't take it.
Broke up with him one night and about a week later he showed up at my parent's house wanting to talk to me.
My mom answered the door, I didn't want any part of it, so she told him to go away.
He got belligerent and eventually left, so she called the police.
He was pulled over, and given a warning, then they let him be.
Dad was at work, mom took sister somewhere, and I was playing Mario Party 8 on my Wii at home.
There was a knock at the back door and I look through the glass from the couch and he was there looking in trying to talk to me.
Again, I didn't want any part of it so I ignored him.
He got mad and shouldered the door.
The frame cracked.
He did it again and the door burst open.
I said, 'What the fuck are you doing?
' and he grabbed me and put me over his shoulder and carried me outside.
I figured he was just going to put me in the front seat and leave with me but then he popped the trunk of his car with the remote and I realized what was going to happen.
I twisted a little, which surprised him, and he dropped me, but then he put me in a headlock where I couldn't breathe and I stopped struggling.
He tossed me in the trunk and shut it and drove off.
At this point, I was doing everything I could to get out of the trunk ((It was a Buick Le Sabre; the model which, of course, doesn't have a way to open the trunk from the inside)) so I started kicking the back of the seats to get out.
I eventually got one open enough to stick my head through to get some air.
It was in August, and the temperatures outside were riding 95 degrees, so inside the trunk was about 110.
I got my head out and could finally breathe.
He had calmed down a bit, and I knew he just wanted to talk to me, so he didn't really freak when I was able to climb into the backseat.
When he was putting me in the trunk, the neighbor kids were outside and they saw what was happening and ran inside to tell their parents.
Parents called the police, police called my mom, and my mom was doing 95 down the highway to get home.
Ex-bf drove me an hour and a half away to an old camp he used to go to and we talked for a while.
He then took me to Pizza Hut cause I said I was hungry.
I remember wondering why no one was concerned that I was waiting for a pizza without shoes or socks on.
Because no one said anything, I figured my parents hadn't realized what had happened yet.
Little did I know, an Amber Alert had already been issued.
Anyways, he decided he didn't want to go to jail, so he was going back to his workplace/place of residence to get his shotgun.
When he got there, the cops were waiting for him and tried to taser him.
They missed and he jumped back in his car and did a backwards u-turn.
He started driving through the city at speeds of 60-85 MPH.
If you've never been in a high speed police pursuit, let me tell you; it's a rush.
Sooooo much adrenaline.
Anyways, he was going to get on the highway but the police had it blocked off with spike strips so he turned onto a backroad that dead ended.
He ended up crashing into a tree.
((I was in the front seat by this time.
))

The cops swarmed the car, pulled us both out, and since they didn't realize who we were, cuffed us both and put us in separate cop cars.
Once everything was situated, the un-cuffed me and put me in a police SUV and transported me back to the police station in my city.
Parents and sister were there, freaked out, found out I was ok.
The whole ordeal lasted around 10 hours.
Ex got 4 years and is now out of jail in a half-way house.

During sexytimes, it was missionary, her on bottom, me on top.
No thrusting, just ""put it in and lay there"".
No fingers anywhere on her body, no foreplay on her at all.
She didn't shave, or trim, or anything, so it was like a forest down there (dodged a bullet there..)

5.
Also during sexytimes, and this ""rule"" is the one that surprises people the most because of how ridiculous it is, when SHE thought it was time for me to cum, SHE would roll over on her side and say ""go finish up in the bathroom"".
She was outright disgusted by cum, and under no circumstances was my cum to get on her, around her or be in the same room as her unless it was inside my nuts.

He is about 6'3"" and weighs about 350 lbs.
The procedure was to have them remove their underwear turn around facing away from the officer and squat and cough.

I gave them back to him and HE PUT THEM BACK ON!

30	"My son was 3 when I got into a heated argument with my wife over water safety one day when we were at the beach.
I didn't feel like she was paying attention as much as one should when around the water.
I had just arrived from work and saw something I didn't like and said some things in a way I should not have.
Needless to say I felt like an ass both for what I said, how I said it and because I knew I had not made my point properly.
2 weeks later I arrived at the beach again after work.
My son ran up to me gave me a hug and wanted to kick a soccer ball around.
A couple minutes later I heard a sound and so I turned to look at the water.
A mom was swimming into shore from a floating dock and her 5 or 6 year old was walking into the water out to meet her mom.
Mom was saying ""One minute, I'm coming... be right there..."" But the daughter kept walking, past her knees past her waist...

My son kicked the soccer ball, and I remember it rolled right by me, but I was mesmerized by what was going on.
""Daddy?
Daddy...?
"" I faintly heard.
The mothers voice grew more worried, she grew more frantic.
She was not a strong/fast swimmer at all, no more so than your average parent and she was still 100m or more away.
Daughter kept walking in right up to her chest and then

She turned, she knew she was in trouble.
Her eyes bulged from her face as she turned around, lips trembling, then silently, without a yelp nor a peep, slipped underwater.
Nary a ripple left a mark.
By that point I was already crashing across the field and beach to dive into where I last saw her.
I dove in, dove down, and touched nothing.
She was gone.
I wear contacts because of my exceedingly bad eye sight.
I opened my eyes as I dove in and water blasted my eyes, causing one contact to fly out and the other just floated around on top of my eye.
I could see nothing.
I extended my hands all around and felt the faint touch of lake grass on the bottom... or was that hair?
I grabbed it her head, shoulders and waist and threw her up onto my shoulder as I struggled fully clothed in a suit (sans jacket), to walk the 4 or 5 steps to shore I new would be all I needed to break the surface myself.
She was fine, albeit a bit scared.
I put her down and she didn't even cough.
Through the whole episode she was underwater for less than 20 seconds I would guess.
I looked around and out of the 40 or 50 people around the area, only two had taken note of the 250lbs crazy guy running flat out across the beach only to dive into the water fully clothed.
Not a single person other than myself and the mom saw the girl go under.

Surrounding the meadow is a forest.
It looked similar to the forest in the Harry Potter.
Despite it being quite sunny in the meadow, the forest appeared to be shrouded in shadow.

They're screaming and somethings chasing them.

She is slightly translucent and her pitch black eyes are fixed on me.
She then starts to slowly ascend the stairs.
I would then freeze with fear.
Once she got almost close enough to touch me I would sprint into my parents bedroom and jump into their bed.
This is were the dream would then end and unusually enough when I awoke I would be in my parents bed.

This, however seemed to have little effect and I ran as usual.
This was the last night that this dream occurred.

36	"When my best friend and i went backpacking in Europe - we had just left Oktoberfest in Munich and got on the night train to Paris.
In the mix of things we accidentally switched tickets, i found my cabin with 5 quiet Asian travelers and we all went to sleep pretty much right after the train started to go.
After the heavy amount of partying that took place, that sleep was one of the best ones that i've had.
I woke up in the morning feeling refreshed and went to look for my friend a few cabins away, but she was gone.
After locating my her and seeing how much she looked like shit, she proceeded to tell me that her cabin was made up of 5 drunk french men, 5 very drunk french men.
They had a good 1-2 hours of being rowdy and loud for a while then things finally started to quiet down in the cabin.
In the middle of the night my friend felt someone smack her head.
She thought it was the very burly drunk men sleeping in the bunk right across from hers and just moved farther back into the bunk towards the wall.
When someone smacked her head again.
She lifts her head up and something falls off.
she touches it and its poo.
the 250lb man was shitting his pants and throwing poo at her in his drunken sleep.
She screamed ran out of the bunk and found someone that works on the train.
The woman laughed at her and directed her to the bathroom, where the sinks water pressure was equivalent to the water pressure of something with low water pressure.. (i can't think of a clever analogy right now).
She refused to go back to the bunk, had to go find an empty seat for the duration of the train ride.
So happy to finally share that.

I'll talk to anyone, so I meet a lot of interesting people.
This night is one of my favorites:

I was walking down the street in Sag Harbor, New York (the Hamptons).
I lit my cigarette and this guy asks me for a light.
He is dressed down, kinda rough looking.
We talk until we finish smoking, and he invites me into an expensive bar for a drink.
He buys me a $25 glass of cognac (only about 1/4-inch full), and introduces me to his wife and friend, some famous artist.
We have a few drinks and swap stories.
He had sailed his boat from Connecticut, and the water was too rough to return.
His son and daughter-in-law had to be back home for work the next morning, so he had his helicopter pick him up.
We all went to a haunted house, they smoked a bowl, and we returned to the bar.
Turns out this guy is a mobster and rich as fuck.
We go out for another cigarette, and a bus pulls up with three attractive women with baggage.
The mobster invites them in for drinks and tries to get me laid.
The hottest of the girls was shocked that I didn't know who she was.
She claimed to be an actress, so I asked what movie she was in.
She says ""Money Talks"".
I check IMDB, and she is not listed.
I then remember that there is a porn with the same title.
She was a porn-star.
I personally racked up a $1,200 bar-tab that night, all of which the mobster insisted in paying for.
I cabbed it back to the house I was staying at and called it a night.
I never heard back from any of the group.

43	"About 10 years back I was introduced to weed by a few friends.
One of them was named George (not really name for obvious reasons).
George and I smoked together a few more times at his house with little to no problems, but one night it all changed.
We both pitched in on rolling a blunt, and smoked it on his couch until we both got pretty high.
He had previously been in encounters with other men, but I had made it very clear I was not interested in that, I just liked his company.
Anyways, we were enjoying ourselves watching Star Wars on his t.v, when suddenly he pulls of his pants and starts masturbating in front of me.
I scorned him to stop immediately (I knew he was at least at an [8] so I cut him some slack) or I would leave.
He then proceeds to look me directly in the eyes, which creeped me the fuck out, and asked me to help him finish.
I got up without saying a word and rushed to the door.
Unfortunately I underestimated his speed, both for movement, and masturbating.
Time itself froze, he came towards me (no pun intended) and released what seemed like a life time build up of lust.
Somehow I managed to jolt to the left, allowing me to dodge the spray that eventually covered the door.
We both stood still for what seemed like an eternity, until he collapsed in a pool of his own filth.
This gave me enough time to rush to the backdoor, were I made my narrow escape..or so it seemed.
I realized I had forgotten my keys on the couch where the incident had begun.
I didn't know what to do.
Since it was close to -10F outside and my house was more than 20 miles away, I had no other option.
I quickly and quietly ventured back inside, heart-racing, and with a sense alertness I had never felt before.
I spotted my keys lying on the edge of the couch, and made the poor choice of glancing at the door I had earlier tried to escape through.
He was gone.
Evidence still covered the scene, but he was gone.
I lunged to grab my keys, and just as I did, he appeared from behind the couch.
It was now a life and death situation.
Like a gazelle being chased by a hungry lion, I darted as quickly as I could for the backdoor, being chased by what was now a fully naked George who was furiously masturbating.
We've all seen those horror movies where the victim being chased by an ax murderer frantically fumbles with their keys, trying to open their car door.
Fortunately this was not one of those situations, and I made my narrow escape.
The last time I ever saw him was from my rear-view mirror, masturbating in the snowfall.

44	"In high school, I never studied except maybe the night before exams.
I was taking a college physics class that was pretty difficult, but our teacher never cared what we did during class, treating us more like college students.
Doing work was on you.
One day I walked into class ready to play a game, work on other class work, or just chat with my friends like I did every day.
I look around and everyone is spread out.
My teacher exclaims ""Alright everyone, get out your calculators and a pencil.
Exam day.
"" I had no bleeping idea there was an exam and I wasn't even sure what it was over.
Instead of trying to think of a way out, I knew I was screwed.
His exams were difficult, there was nothing I could do.
I took a seat, got a pencil and simply thought I would write expressions and equations down and hope for a 40/100 or something.
I was so sure I wasn't going to do anything that day, I didn't even bring my calculator to school.
Sitting there hopeless and staring at my thermodynamics exam, my professor came up to me and gave me his calculator to use since I forgot mine.
""What a nice guy,"" I thought.
""He has no clue how screwed I am.
"" 

I began the exam simply trying to guess at the math, punching in variables from the problems.
There were 6 pages, each page had one big physics problem.
After writing BS on each page, I actually legitimately tried to do the last problem.
I messed up punching a number in the calculator, so I went back in the calculator memory to retrieve a previous number.
I accidentally went back too far and saw values that the teacher must have punched in when he last used it, since it was his calculator.
However, I noticed that the number that my teacher put in matched a number in the last problem on the test.
I hit it again, another familiar value came up.
I realized just then that my teacher had just taken the entire exam himself so he could gage how long to give his students.
Using the calculator that MY TEACHER gave me, I worked the entire test backward using the memory of the calculator.
I got a 94%, missing one point on each page because I never listed the units in my answer (because I had no idea), and I set the curve.

46	"I used to be an employee at Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle.
I was in high school at the time and I didn't have a car so my parents took turns taking me to work and picking me up.
One day my mom tells me that she is going to bring the two kids she babysits and have me give the three of them a quick tour around the highlights of the zoo before we go home.
After I finish my shift I meet up with my mom and the kids and I decided to take them to the tapir exhibit first.
The zoo's tapirs were a breeding pair and the female was pretty far along he her pregnancy.
As we approached the exhibit I explained how the zoo keepers were expecting the tapir to give birth any day now.
We reach the exhibit and one of the tapirs walks right up to the glass and suddenly something pink starts emerging from beneath it.
The kids point it out almost immediately and second by second its coming further and further out.
My mother starts screaming ""OH MY GOD THE TAPIR IS GIVING BIRTH!
OH MY GOD YOU HAVE TO GO GET A ZOO KEEPER THE TAPIR IS GIVING BIRTH!"".
As a typical teenager I was easily embarrassed by my parents, but this was a new low.
A huge crowd almost instantly formed and my mom wouldn't let me get a word in edgewise.
I wanted to tell her that the tapir has the largest penis to body ratio of any animal in the world.
I wanted to explain that the tapir was just proudly sprouting a boner for the ever growing crowd to admire, but she wouldn't hear it.
I melted into the crowd and abandoned her.
Maybe I was a terrible son...

It was fun for a while but I eventually got sick of not really having a ""home"".
Anyways, one of my favorite stories...
Happened of course when nobody else was around to corroborate the story.
I was in the middle of the backroads of upstate New York somewhere in the middle of the night, I'm gonna say around 2 AM or so.
I was cruising around 50 MPH or so, since there were no cars, and the road was wide open.
So I'm chugging along fully loaded on my way to the first store when I see what looked like a small bump, no big deal.
As I get closer I realize exactly how big this bump is and the fact that in reality it's a raised railroad track.
By this time, I was way too damn close to slow down at all.
I swear to god when it was all said and done I managed to get at least 5 feet of air in that thing.
After the shock of what just happened settled, and I realized that I landed it without breaking anything, I let out one of the most fulfilled screams of excitement as if I had just gotten off of the worlds best roller coasters.
My company obviously was never told of this one.
I have many more stories if anyone wants to hear them.

You guys aren't the most cautious drivers to begin with and when the snow hit MY GAWD.
During one stretch of highway about 30 miles I saw no less that thirteen cars and two big rigs eat shit or pass by the wreckage and remnants of one that had not too long ago.
A few of them definitely being a fatality.

We stopped the truck and bailed out to help.
She had been wearing a seatbelt but the violence of the rolling slipped her out of it.
She was unconscious and began to choke on her vomit.
My Dad and another guy who stopped pulled her out and laid her on her side and called 911.
They were given instructions by the dispatcher until the ambulance arrived.
It was a bit of a story in Leeds and I followed the articles on the web.
She's okay, no brain damage, but is expected to make a full, if not lengthy, recovery.

53	"Not me, but my father told me last week about a couple years ago when he was driving a road train here in Queensland, Australia.
It was him and three other road trains I think, and he was second in line.
Some guy tried to overtake all of them before the overtaking lane ended.
This lane isn't very long (about 1km) and they are few and far between along this road.
Now this guy had run out of room by the time he had gotten to the truck at the front, and so he went off the road and rolled his car.
The trucks all stopped and my father got out and ran towards the car, which was now on fire.
The first truck driver was much closer to the car than my father was, due to these trucks being a good hundred metres long.
When Dad got there the truck driver just had his hands in the air as if to say, ""Fuck this, nope, I can't handle this.
"" What he had seen was the man, still conscious, flailing about in the car, burning alive.
Dad didn't want to see something so horrid that so he didn't look, but he was still haunted by the fact a man was alive one minute ago, driving past him, but was now in the burning car he saw ahead.
The truck driver is still basically a basket case today, from what I've heard.
He still can't get over it, and feels terrible, but it's definitely not his fault.
Driving back from the road trip someone tried overtaking my father again on that same stretch of road, not 2kms away from the night before.
There were police up ahead and the guy was up to about 200km just to get ahead of dad before the lane ended.
So he slams on the breaks just before he can get seen by the coppers, and Dad says he barely braked in time to not send him flying ahead, due to road trains having a much harder time braking than a car does.
They get pulled over and my Dad abused the fuck out of this guy because he was still upset about the night before and he sure as hell didn't want to see that shit again, and the guy acted like he had no idea what he did.
I have never seen my Dad afraid, but I could see in his eyes how scared he was when he told me this, because that moment terrified him so much that he could have been the guy who had taken another man's life so quickly.
I hope that people can understand that trucks, especially road trains, don't have the same capabilities as cars, and you should know how to act around them, and know how they work.

Eight black military choppers escorted us in formation for like ten miles, we assumed they were just doing drills and using us for fake target practice or something.
A little while later we are parked and about to start hiking to the fire line when suddenly a thin column of smoke shoots probably about two hundred feet into the sky, it was a good mile away but the concussion was pretty significant when it hit us and the noise was still ridiculously loud.
We thought it was probably no big deal, we knew we were near a  strike zone.
A good five minutes later an aircraft like nothing I have ever seen flew by us at maybe five hundred feet.
It was flat black and sort of rectangular but with fins and wells on the underside.
It was moving pretty slow and was dead silent so I have to assume it was some sort of stealth glider.
It sounds ridiculous but it immediately reminded me of a huge, flying bat mobile, Time Burton era.
After that some military personnel got on our radio frequency and instructed us to leave the area immediately, when our crew chief asked who it was and why they signed off and the Incident Commander (the guy in charge of managing the entire situation) came on the radios and said we were evacuating the area.
They sent us to a completely different fire about a hundred miles to the south and never told us why except that it was higher priority which was bullshit, it was already out when we got there and we just assisted crews in the mop up operation.
The thing that confuses me about this is that if the army didn't want us to see that shit or if it was dangerous why didn't they keep us clear of the area in the first place?

56	"Edray, WV One night few years back my friend (who is driving) and I were taking his girlfriend home when he decided to take the ""long way home"".
As we are driving along this fairly deserted back road I began to zone out and I stare at this blinking red light off in the distance and casually think to myself ""I wonder when they built a cell phone tower all the way out here.
"" When suddenly it blinks and is dramatically closer than it was just a moment earlier, at this point my friend points it out and stops in the road.
It blinks once more and is directly in front and over top of us, the red light is so bright it floods the car in a deep scarlet hue.
I lean forward so that I can see directly into the light, in that brief moment I feel a flood of negative emotions the closest description I can offer is to that of being naked under a giant microscope and having every pore examined thoroughly.
I then look away from the light to my friend and ask him to drive, he barely responds apparently in a similar state.
Then he snaps out of it and starts driving, as we get a little ways down the road I notice the red light isn't fading and the interior of the car is still clearly lit by it.
I look out the window and to my horror the light is following us and does so for approximately 1-2 miles.
The light unexpectedly veers off to the left and comes down to ground level in a patch of trees adjacent to the road.
My friend stops the car again and continues to stare at it and abruptly declares he is going to get out and look it like he is in some sort of trance.
He opens the door and I grab his arm and tell him if he does I will get in the driver seat and leave him, that we had to leave that instant.
He looks at me and seems to come to and punches the gas so hard the tires lose traction and spin.
The light remained stationary as we rode away but I've never looked at the night sky the same.

68	"Okay so even though this isn't supernatural or ""creepy"" or anything it was fucking scary!
I live in Sydney, AUS and this was probably just over a year ago.
I was driving with my girlfriend back to my home after going out to dinner at her friends house in Bondi, which is about 15 minutes away from my area called Watsons Bay.
To get back to my place you need to drive down into the valley near the harbour down a long winding main road that progressively takes you down to the water.
It was around 1:30 or 2am and we were making our way down the road not really paying attention to much, and she suddenly grabs my arm and gasps (which freaked me out already).
As i'm looking around as to what the fuck is going on, we approach the roundabout and there is a man in medical looking attire next to a woman in what looked like white pyjamas, with blood covering a lot of her clothing.
Now obviously my balls drop and instinct kicks in as i speed up, it's quite a small roundabout so i need to either slow down enough to turn left, or speed up and nope the fuck straight out of there.
I go straight, and as we go past the woman attempts to launch herself at my car as the man looked like he was trying to stop her.
I speed off, we get home about 3 or 4 minutes later and we're both shaken and basically scared shitless.
Called the police to inform them of what we just saw, and got a call back the next afternoon explaining how a woman had somehow run away from a mental home and was attempting to commit suicide using sharp objects and running onto main roads.
The man was one of the first workers who knew her on the scene and apparently they managed to bring her back to where she lived, heard nothing more after that.

73	"Hope this doesn't  get buried,first and probably last time i post this.
Was driving from Atlanta GA to Lexington SC with my GF to visit my parents.
I like to drive at night since there are less people on the road and I can take my time.
At around 3am or so we are making good time.
I had stopped at a gas station and picked up some coffee for us and we were due in in about an hour.
GF was sleeping soundly and I'm listening to a quiet radio humming away.
I start getting a little drowsy and take a sip.
Road was just as my coffee, no cars in sight except for a spotted few on the side of the road here and there.
In the distance I can make out what looks like a hitch hiker, or what I think is one, but can't really tell due to such low light.
As I get closer I start to notice other things, like how the person is kinda thin and tall and completly, for the most part, apparently brown.
I'm right up on this thing now, and at about 20 feet it turns around and locks eyes with me as I pass by.
This was no person.
And it is the most terrifying thing I have ever seen in my life.
It was a deer.
Or I tell myself it was.
I have seen deer stand on their hind legs to fight, but they still have deer posture when they do.
not only that, but I was watching this thing walk for about 30 seconds from first seeing it in the distance to passing it.
The posture it had was human.
Standard biped stance.
Arms back, chin down.
But the worse part was the eyes, or lack there of.
In their place were two large black pits, almost black-holish.
I'll never forget the stare down it gave me.
The instant I passed it I had the only panic attack I've ever had in my life.
I had to wake up my gf to keep calm enough to get to an exit with a large gas station a few miles away.
Like hell I was going off a ramp close to that thing.
After we pulled into the station I had a complete meltdown.
I started crying harder than I ever thought I could.
I couldn't talk, breath, or do anything but want to curl into a ball and cry.
After around 30 minutes or so, she finally gets me to calm down enough to tell her what happened.
While I don't think she believed what I think I saw, she knew that I was convinced and legitimately scared to death.
Every once in a blue moon I will dream about it and wake up crying or in a cold sweat, and she will tease me about it or roll over and ignore me instead of comforting me about the one thing that I've ever been terrified of.
But I know what I saw, and I know it will haunt me for the rest of my life.

74	"Okay, some nautical creepiness for you.
Maybe more weird than creepy but it spooked me.
I was in the Coast Guard for 4 years, two of them spent on a 210' Cutter home-ported in NC, so we did a lot of patrols in the Caribbean, and naturally, we passed through the Bermuda triangle frequently.
Before you call bs or aliens, the Caribbean and anywhere near the Sargasso sea can be pretty spooky on it's own right.
I'm talking dead calm conditions where the sea melts into the horizon and it looks like you are trapped in a huge sphere of blue, freak squalls that come up surprisingly quickly, St. Elmo's fire, you name it.
Anyways, we (me and the rest of deck department) would have to stand watch for 4 hours at all times of day, either 4 hours standing up manning the helm or 4 hours up on the flying bridge standing lookout.
I was frequently stuck on the 4-8's (4am to 8am) the very definition of the graveyard watch.
So one night I'm on helm, in the Bermuda triangle, and the quartermaster asks me for a compass check (where you look in a little window at the magnetic compass reading), and it's spinning rapidly.
It sent a chill down my spine.
Never in a million years did I think this actually happened.
But there it was spinning away.
When I tried to explain to the QM why I couldn't give him a compass check, the GPS computer suddenly went dead, just simply quit.
(which is obvious because it illuminates the QM's desk).
The Officer of the Watch immediately goes up to the flying bridge to make sure there isn't anything metal affecting the compass, and calls the Captain on deck, and engineers to fix the computer.
It continued like this for the next 45 min, with everyone on the bridge on full alert thinking there was a sub tailing the ship, and sonar repeatedly showed nothing.
The captain (who is usually super professional) finally goes: ""Welp, that's the weirdest fucking shit I've ever seen.
"" and retreats to his cabin.
The poor QM had to plot coordinates by dead reckoning until we got to Miami.
I have plenty more spooky sea stories I can post later if people are interested.

After a morning class, he decided that he would hitchhike back home to Lincoln Park on the North side instead of pay for a taxi.
A man drove up in a Plymouth Satellite and offered my Uncle a ride.
The man looked normal and seemed friendly...lighthearted even, so my Uncle got in the car and they started driving towards Lake Shore Drive.
However, once they got there, the man drove South on Lake Shore instead of North, towards Lincoln Park.
My Uncle told the man he was going the wrong way and to turn around and head North.
The man looked at my Uncle, put his hand on his knee and said, ""No son, you are coming with me"" and smiled darkly at him.
My Uncle froze in panic, and when they hit traffic near the South Shore, he quickly unlocked the passenger door and ran away without looking back.
A year or two later on a cold December day, my Uncle was having coffee in a cafe with my future Aunt when he caught something on the TV that made his blood run cold.
He saw the man that had picked him up from school that day the year before.
He had been arrested for the suspected rape and killing of over 20 young men and boys.
The man on the television was John Wayne Gacy.
And he had removed the door handle off the passenger side door to prevent the men he picked up from escaping.

82	"This story was told to me by a girl who I recently moved in with.
It happened to her a few years ago and when she told me about it sent shivers down my spine.
She was attending the biggest Irish horse racing meeting of the year known as ""The Galway Races""- it is a basically a huge piss up where the whole city goes to the pub and gambles for several days.
People from all over the country come to Galway city and usually end up staying outside of the city in rural areas as everywhere is booked up in the city itself.
This girl in particular was staying in a small house on a narrow, secluded country lane with a friend of hers.
One night she and her friend came home quite drunk and they realised that they had no key to get in to the house.
They sat down at the front of the house and had a rest while trying to figure out what to do.
She told me she had a very strange feeling that something was wrong at this stage and instantly sobered up.
The road was completely quiet and there was no street lamps as it was not a main road.
The two girls walked down the road a hundred yards or so to the next house and knocked on the door.
After a few minutes the neighbour answered the door and gave them a spare key she had.
The girls then went home and went straight to bed.
The next morning they looked out the window to see two police cars outside and a line of police tape cordoning off the narrow road.
They spoke to the officers who told them that a man had been walking home from the races and was hit by a car outside there door.
The officers then explained that the man had been killed in a hit and run and was lying on the ground still alive throughout the night.
They also said he was struck before the time when they had arrived home.
Meaning that they had been sitting several feet from the dieing man when they rested on the doorstep.
I have been following reddit for a year now but only signed up today as I was reading all these spooky stories and decided to share this one with you all.
I hope you like it and that my reddiquette is up to scratch.

Both my parents worked so I was often alone when I came home from school.
One early evening when I came home the house was still dark.
I called out, ""Mum?
"" and heard her sing song voice say ""Yeeeeees?

I called her again as I climbed the stairs to see which room she was in, and again got the same ""Yeeeeees?

We were decorating at the time, and I didn't know my way around the maze of rooms but she was in one of the far ones, right down the hall.
I felt uneasy, but I figured that was only natural so I rushed forward to see my mum, knowing that her presence would calm my fears, as a mother's presence always does.
Just as I reached for the handle of the door to let myself in to the room I heard the front door downstairs open and my mother call ""Sweetie, are you home?
"" in a cheery voice.
I jumped back, startled and ran down the stairs to her, but as I glanced back from the top of the stairs, the door to the room slowly opened a crack.
For a brief moment, I saw something strange in there, and I don't know what it was, but it was staring at me.

Does anyone remember this kid's show?
It was called Candle Cove and I must have been 6 or 7, I never found reference to it anywhere so I think it was on a local station around 1971 or 1972.
I lived in Ironton at the time.
I don't remember which station, but I do remember it was on at a weird time, like 4:00 PM.

it seems really familiar to me.....i grew up outside of ashland and was 9 yrs old in 72. candle cov...wasit about pirates?
i remember a pirate marionete at the mouth of a cave talking to a little girl



*Skyshale033*

*Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid's show?
*

YES!
Okay I'm not crazy!
I remember Pirate Percy.
I was always kind of scared of him.
He looked like he was built from parts of other dolls, real low-budget.
His head was an old porcelain baby doll, looked like an antique that didn't belong on the body.
I don't remember what station this was!
I don't think it was WTSF though.
*Jaren_2005*

*Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid's show?

Sorry to ressurect this old thread but I know exactly what show you mean, Skyshale.
I think Candle Cove ran for only a couple months in '71, not '72.
I was 12 and I watched it a few times with my brother.
It was channel 58, whatever station that was.
My mom would let me switch to it after the news- Let me see what I remember.
It took place in Candle cove, and it was about a little girl who imagined herself to be friends with pirates.
The pirate ship was called the Laughingstock, and Pirate Percy wasn't a very good pirate because he got scared too easily.
And there was calliope music constantly playing.
Don't remember the girl's name.
Janice or Jade or something.
Think it was Janice.
*Skyshale033*

*Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid's show?

Thank you Jaren!!!
Memories flooded back when you mentioned the Laughingstock and channel 58.
I remember the bow of the ship was a wooden smiling face, with the lower jaw submerged.
It looked like it was swallowing the sea and it had that awful Ed Wynn voice and laugh.
I especially remember how jarring it was when they switched from the wooden/plastic model, to the foam puppet version of the head that talked.
*mike_painter65*

*Skyshale033*

*Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid's show?

Ugh mike, I got a chill reading that.
Yes I remember.
That's what the ship always told Percy when there was a spooky place he had to go in, like a cave or a dark room where the treasure was.
And the camera would push in on Laughingstock's face with each pause.
YOU HAVE... TO GO...
INSIDE.
With his two eyes askew and that flopping foam jaw and the fishing line that opened and closed it.
Ugh.
It just looked so cheap and awful.
You guys remember the villain?
He had a face that was just a handlebar mustache above really tall, narrow teeth.

i honestly, honestly thought the villain was pirate percy- i was about 5 when this show was on.
nightmare fuel.
*Jaren_2005*

*Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid's show?
*

That wasn't the villain, the puppet with the mustache.
That was the villain's sidekick, Horace Horrible.
He had a monocle too, but it was on top of the mustache.
I used to think that meant he had only one eye.
But yeah, the villain was another marionette.
The Skin-Taker.
I can't believe what they let us watch back then.

jesus h. christ, the skin taker.
what kind of a kids show were we watching?
i seriously could not look at the screen when the skin taker showed up.
he just descended out of nowhere on his strings, just a dirty skeleton wearing that brown top hat and cape.
and his glass eyes that were too big for his skull.
christ almighty.
*Skyshale033*

*Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid's show?

Wasn't his top hat and cloak all sewn up crazily?
Was that supposed to be children's skin??
*mike_painter65*

*Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid's show?
*

yeah i think so.
rememer his mouth didn't open and close, his jaw just slid back and foth.
i remember the little girl said ""why does your mouth move like that"" and the skin-taker didn't look at the girl but at the camera and said ""TO GRIND YOUR SKIN""



*Skyshale033*

*Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid's show?
*

I'm so relieved that other people remember this terrible show!
I used to have this awful memory, a bad dream I had where the opening jingle ended, the show faded in from black, and all the characters were there, but the camera was just cutting to each of their faces, and they were just screaming, and the puppets and marionettes were flailing spastically, and just all screaming, screaming- The girl was just moaning and crying like she had been through hours of this- I woke up many times from that nightmare- I used to wet the bed when I had

There was no plot or anything, I mean literally just standing in place crying and screaming for the whole show.

Oh God.
Yes.
The little girl, Janice, I remember seeing her shake.
And the Skin-Taker screaming through his gnashing teeth, his jaw careening so wildly I thought it would come off its wire hinges.
I turned it off and it was the last time I watched.
I ran to tell my brother and we didn't have the courage to turn it back on.

It was six more minutes until after school.
As he was doing his homework, something caught his eye.
His desk was next to the window, and he turned and looked to the grass outside.
It looked like a picture.
When school was over, he ran to the spot where he saw it.
He ran fast so that no one else could grab it.
He picked it up and smiled.
It had a picture of the most beautiful girl he had ever seen.
She had a dress with tights on and red shoes, and her hand was formed into a peace sign.
She was so beautiful he wanted to meet her, so he ran all over the school and asked everyone if they knew her or have ever seen her before.
But everyone he asked said ""No.

When he was home, he asked his older sister if she knew the girl, but unfortunately she also said ""No.

It was like a nail tapping.
He got scared.
After the tapping he heard a giggle.
He saw a shadow near his window, so he got out of his bed, walked toward his window, opened it up and followed the giggling.
By the time he reached it, it was gone.
The next day again he asked his neighbors if they knew her.
Everybody said, ""Sorry, no.
"" When his mother came home he even asked her if she knew her.
She said ""No.

Once again he was awakened by a tapping.
He took the picture and followed the giggling.

It was getting dark, and having lost his bearings, he decided to head in one direction until he was clear of the increasingly oppressive foliage.
After a what seemed like hours, he came across a cabin in a small clearing.
Realizing how dark it had grown, he decided to see if he could stay there for the night.
He approached, and found the door ajar.
Nobody was inside.
The hunter flopped down on the single bed, deciding to explain himself to the owner in the morning.
As he looked around, he was suprised to see the walls adorned by many portraits, all painted in incredible detail.
Without exception, they appeared to be staring down at him, their features twisted into looks of hatred.
Staring back, he grew increasingly uncomfortable.
Making a concerted effort to ignore the many hateful faces, he turned to face the wall, and exhausted, he fell into a restless sleep.
Face down in an unfamiliar bed, he turned blinking in unexpected sunlight.
Looking up, he discovered that the cabin had no portraits, only windows.

88	"This story (story within a story) was told to me by a friend Mark:

During high school Mark was over at his friend's house, we'll just call him Steve b/c I don't know his name.
They were hanging out in Steve's room after just hanging up a poster of Limp Bizkit's ""Significant Other"" album cover that Steve had just bought.
Minutes later Steve's dad comes by and orders him to take the poster down immediately.
When he asked his dad why, he says never mind why and to just listen to him and do it.
Steve is pissed but listens to his dad and takes it down.
Later Steve asked his dad why he told him to take down the poster.
This is the story he told him:

When I was young, your aunt, uncles and I had to all sleep on the floor in one room because we were very poor.
One night someone walked into the room, bent over my head and asked me, ""Give me your soul.
"" I was so afraid I'd pretend to be asleep.
This thing would ask me to give him my soul a few times then get up and walk out of the room.
This happened every other night until I reached my early teens.
One night after he was walking away I opened my eyes to see his face.
What I saw was a thing with the body of a human, he wore a hood and underneath the hood was a face of a lizard.
A few years before you were born we threw a Halloween party at our house with all of our family.
We ran out of candy so I drove to the local market to pick some more up.
On the way there I was listening to the radio and they said to call in with your scariest story.
I pulled over to the side of the road, called them on a pay phone and told the story of this lizard man over the air.
When I got back home I could hear someone crying.
I went upstairs into the bedroom and saw my sister crying on the bed.
I asked her what was  wrong.
She said, **""I heard you on the radio.
That happened to me too.

Never did figure out if it was real or just a really vivid night terror.
*****************************************************


There I was, reading my Sesame Street book, all cozy in my bunk bed with my siblings and parents fast asleep leaving me and my imagination awake to entertain ourselves.
I was a little nerdy bookworm who would read when I couldn't sleep at night (which was nearly every night), but this particular night something felt off.
As I lay there, reading with only the moonlight streaming in from my bedroom window as my flashlight, I realized how cold the room had gotten.
In an attempt to stave off the night chill, I set my book down next to me and pulled my quilts up closer to my chin.
The book slid down and fell into the crack between the wall and my bed, so instinctively I reached down to retrieve my lost treasure.
As I was pulling the book up, however, I felt a slight tug on the end of it.
Like this would keep me from my Grover!
I pulled back, IT pulled back.
I pulled again, and IT pulled back STRONGER.
A flash of a hand could be seen then even in the darkness, and my eyes grew wide.
All of a sudden, the child in me reeled with fear as the knowledge of all those terrible stories might possibly be true.
Now, would I try to get my book back or face certain death?
I'll admit, I was one risk-loving kid.
This was nothing to be fooling with, though, so I let go.
The book hit the hardwood floor with a THUD and I heard a scrapping under my bed like nails on a chalkboard.
As stiff as a board, I didn't move an inch except to dart my eyes to my sleeping sister in the bed ten feet away.
All I heard was the soft snore from the unmoving form, as well as from my dreaming younger brother above.
The next morning, thinking it had just been a figment of my lovely imagination, I go under the bed to get back my cherished possession... only to find it nowhere to be found.
All that was left was a deep scratch in the floor next to where the book should have been.
Needless to say, I read in my well-lit closet with the door shut and a mound of blankets for years after.

92	"Sorry if this has already been told.
Tried a search which turned up nothing, but you never know.
Late at night on a highway in Northern Ontario, a woman driving her car is reliieved to finally find a gas station that's still open, so she pulls in.
The attendant comes out and walks up to the driver's side.
He stands there, waiting until she rolls down her window.
She slips it down just a crack.
""How much?
"" he asks.
She tells him to fill it up.
The attendant walks towards the back of the car and stands there a minute.
The woman waits, then looks into the side-view mirror.
The attendant is just standing there, facing her.
She's feeling pretty nervous, wondering why he's not pumping gas.
Then he walks back up to the window and taps on it.
""You need to open the flap ma'am.
""

Feeling stupid, the woman reaches down and clicks the gas flap open.
The attendant walks back and starts pumping the gas.
A minute or so later he finishes, and clicks the nozzle back into place on the pump.
Then he stands there for a moment.
The woman keeps looking at him in the side-view mirror, feeling quite ill-at-ease.
She doesn't like this: being alone at a tiny gas station in the middle of nowhere with only this stranger.
The attendant then walks back up to the window and taps on it.
She reaches into her purse and takes out her credit card, rolls open the window just a crack again, and as she passes the card through looks up at the attendant.
He's staring down at her with wide, frightful eyes.
She looks away quickly, really creeped out, and she rolls the window back up as soon as the attendant grasps the card.
But he doesn't go to the cash booth, he just stands there a moment.
The woman can't bear to look at him again.
Finally he says, with a voice muffled through the closed window: ""Ma'am, there's a problem with your card.
Could you please step inside the cash booth?
"" 

""What's wrong with the card?
"" she asks loudly, with a definite strain in her voice.
""Something's wrong with the barcode.
I'll need you to come over to the cash so we can make a call to the company.
"" 

There's no way she is getting outside her car, on an empty, dark highway, late at night, with only that weirdo around.
Besides, she realizes, as a sudden chill overcomes her, how could he know if there was a problem with the barcode if he hadn't even been to the cash desk to swipe it?
The woman's breathing suddenly increases as she feels panic creep upon her.
She summons up a note of restraint in her voice: ""Please, can you just call them yourself?
""

""Sorry, but I'll need to see some I.D.
Could you please just step over to the booth?
It'll only take a minute.
""

Realizing he won't let it be, she whispers a prayer and reaches into her purse to check for cash.
Yes!
She has a fifty dollar bill.
Clutching it in her hand she unrolls the window just a crack yet again and passes it through.
""Nevermind, I'll just pay cash.
""

""Ma'am, are you sure?
"" he asks.
""What?
"" she almost yells, as she accidentally looks up at him again.
The same wide, fearful eyes staring down at her.
She looks away.
""Yes!
Cash!
""

""I can fix the card problem, you just need to come over to the phone with me,"" he says.
She's really terrified now, and half-screams at the man: ""Listen asshole, it's cash!
That's all your getting from me!
""

""Alright, alright,"" he responds, ""Now you just wait right here and I'll go get your change.
Don't move.
I'll be right back.
""

She can see him out of her peripheral vision, walking backwards towards the booth, always facing her.
She can't bear to look his way.
She can't imagine what he has in the booth.
What if he brings it back with him?
*Fuck the change,* she thinks, just as she realizes he also still has her credit card.
She can't take this anymore: *Fuck the card, I'll cancel it!
*

She starts up the car and as soon as it hums to life she tears away and off into the dark night.
The attendant is in his booth on the phone, breathing heavily.
An official-sounding voice on the other end asks: ""Did you tell her?
""

""No,"" the attendant responds, ""I couldn't.
""

""Why not?
""

""He had a knife and a finger to his lips.
I tried to get her out of there, but the whole time he was watching me from the floor behind her seat.

94	"Here goes.
I've always had a bit of paranormal problems in my life.
This is a reddit post, so I'll give the abridged and cut to the good parts.
The most significant first incident was seeing my dead grandfather.
This was at night, I was nine at the time I believe, so I'm in my bed with the door slightly ajar so I can still see the nightlight in the hallway.
Stuffed animal cuddled by my side.
Wake up in the middle of the night.. for no apparent reason.
Usually I would only take up to use the bathroom, which is why there was a nightlight in the hall.
I look around.. it's all dim, as it tends to be in the middle of the night.
And then I notice that the light in the hallway is different.
Moving, even.
My first impulse is to freak out about someone being in the house.
It looks, at first, like it could've been a flashlight of someone coming up the stairs reflecting off the wall and making the light in the hallway strange.
But it's getting brighter.. and there's no sound on the stairs.
The door opens by itself / is pushed open by this glowy.. orb of light, roughly the size of a basketball.
And immediately my intruder panic has become a mix of bewilderment and calm.
The light is very calming.
It drifts over, and ""sits"" on the bed; not making contact with the mattress but hovering just above it towards the foot of my bed and making the bed shift slightly as if weight had been put on it.
And it just sits there a moment.
And I watch.
And then it leaves.
It heads back out into the hallway, this time heading down towards my mother's room.
As soon as it's gone, PANIC takes hold.. but it just went down the hallway towards my mother's room, so that's no good.
I roll over away from the door, pulling the covers over my head and cuddling my stuffed animal overtime.
The next morning...
I tell my mom about what I assume was a really weird dream (REALLY weird, because at that age the only dreams I remembered were nightmares and they never resembled real world places).
Mom breaks out in tears, pulls me into a hug.. and explains that she saw her father (my dead grandfather) come into her room, sit on her bed and tell her it was all going to be okay.
She sent me out to play after that, and called her friends.
We didn't talk about the incident much afterwards.
A few years after that experience, I met a.. person.
I only met her once in person, but shortly after meeting her she appeared in my dreams.
Consistently.
Every night, for YEARS.
She told me that she was there, in my dreams, to help me learn how to dream better.
Specifically, to control the shape and the flow of my dreams; teaching me precise control of lucid dreaming.
This all happened when I was about 13 or so, and lasted until I was 18 when a problem developed in the dreams.
During my time with her, every night was a lucid dream that I remembered vividly the next day.
Sight, sound, sometimes even smell and taste worked properly in the dream world.
I had no problems reading text, and I never encountered any ""random crap"" that people typically have in their dreams.
I had complete control over energy, matter and time within the dream space.
I have never spoken to anyone that had lucid capacity as well as I had it, and many people claim what I experienced was impossible.
I've had other experiences.. but this is running long.
I haven't seen evidence that Reddit is very paranormally inclined, so I usually keep it to myself.

95	"Okay here is mine 

My good friend, band mate, and roommate at the time got invited to play a private party and Cheli's Chili downtown because our band played a lot of gigs at the one in Dearborn and we built up a relationship with them.
He was up on the roof playing and Cuba Gooding Jr., Kid Rock, Dave Cloulier, Jeff Daniels, Chris Chelios, a bunch of celebrities were there.
They were all digging it.
After a while Kid Rock is like ""hey man, wanna jam?
"" and my friend says ""Sure!
"" and gives Kid his spare guitar.
He was playing his Father's priceless guitar; the same one John Denver played.
Anyway, they played his Sweet Home Alabama song along with a few others.
Everyone was absolutely loving it.
Kid Rock says to him, ""Hey man, do you mind if I jam on a few by myself?
"" and my friend said ""sure!?
"" and went to grab a beer and shoot the shit with the hot shots.
After about 10 minutes my friend hears a crash and looks at Kid Rock and sees that he threw his father's guitar OFF OF THE ROOF.
He had some sort of rock star rage and threw it off of the roof.
So my friend ran over to him and questioned him.
""What the fuck man?!
What did you do?
That was my dad's guitar!
"" and Kid Rock said something along the lines of ""Go fuck yourself, kid.
I'm a rock star.
"" (This is not a direct quote but basically what he said.
)

Anyways, my friend pushed him, then Kid Rock pushed him.
Chris Chelios came in and broke everything up and calmed Kid Rock down while Dave Coulier talked to my friend, trying to calm him.
After about 15 minutes, Kid Rock came over and apologized and said he was really sorry that he did what he did and said he would make sure to get the guitar fixed.
He reached in his pocket and gave him all of the money that he had on him ($1,400) and said he will get it fixed.
He also said he'd give him tickets and passes to his next show in Toronto in the following few days.
Kid Rock answered his phone one time and one time only when my friend tried to get the issue resolved.
He blew him off for an entire year.
Chris Chelios ended up stepping up and sending the guitar to Bob Segar's guitar tech who was too busy to fix it, so they sent it off to some other guy who fixed it.
Chris also bought him the guitar of his choice.

97	"Some backstory:  My parents are fundamentalist Christians, and my mom is a further bit more off than even that.
I left it all behind halfway through college.
After college, I had to live at home for a few months because my friend that I was moving in with hadn't found us a place yet.
I had, at the time a Mitsubishi, and I loved it as much as a man could love a car without becoming one of those strange dudes that puts his dick in the exhaust (they are out there, google them.
)  

The car itself had nice metal wheels, but on top of the lug nuts in the center were plastic wheel caps.
The caps themselves were circular and about 4 inches in diameter, with the mitsubishi logo in the middle.
For those of you that don't know, the logo is simply three diamonds pointing outward.
So one day, I notice that the silver paint is chipping off of my wheel caps, and I decide to be a (fake) man and DIY it by taking them off and spray painting them with a fresh coat of ""fuck yeah"" silver.
I took the caps, put them on a newspaper, painted them, and then set the whole package on the kitchen counter to dry.
About an hour later, I'm sitting in the living room fucking around on the internet when my mom comes home from whatever she had been doing.
She took one look down at my wheel caps and froze.
""What are *those*?
""
""Huh?
""
""*Those*.
""
Her voice was so full of malice at that point that I knew it was about to get bad.
This was my mom, and although you of course have no context, I'll just sum her up by saying this was a woman that once, in the middle of our family outing, had a screaming match with a schizophrenic woman because my mom confused the woman'ts mumblings from across the restaurant as her being a ""*witch casting spells on our family.
*""

Back to the story.
""What are *those*?
""
""Huh?
""
""*Those*.
""
""Uh, wheel caps for my car?
I took them off so I could paint...""

Before I could finish, she exploded and started screaming at the top of her lungs about how she was almost convinced that they were ""satanic ninja stars,"" and that she was about to kick me out of the house if I thought I was gonna come in here with that kind of satanic propaganda.
She went off like that for about five minutes, prayed in tongues for another five minutes, and then refused to talk to me for the rest of the day.
I moved across the country soon after that.

"" He had no business, no friends, and no idea what he was doing - he just had a lot of money because his father was a judge.
He was a year younger than me.
We had a fridge stocked with Red Bull, Smirnoff Ice, and Poland Spring and nothing else.
My boyfriend prepared cornish game hens, lobsters, and steak for lunch every day.
I drove the guy around, did his laundry, and wrote his papers for his summer classes.
He lived in a crappy apartment, but he paid each of us $400/wk out of his personal checking account.
He'd pay us to do things like watch TV with him, play touch football, or put on candles and music and have dinner laid out before he and his dates arrived home, so it looked like he had a butler.
Once he had me go to Dick's Sporting Goods to buy him socks.
Another time I read a few chapters of Harry Potter aloud to him.
Eventually he hired a few ""interns"" that were first year Harvard students.
They thought they were going to be helping him make an internet business.
Instead they helped him install WoW and organized his photo albums.
He paid them $500/wk.
The summer culminated with him getting us all drunk, taking us to a tattoo parlor, and trying to pay all of us to get his initials tattooed on our bodies.
My boyfriend and I refused, but my best friend who was tagging along with me that night actually went through with it, and so did a few other people.
The following week his parents discovered what he'd been doing with his money.
By that point he had about 7 employees.
They cut him off, took him out of school, and shut down the ""business.

102	"I had to smuggle a rat from L.A. to NC.
They wouldn't allow her to be on board or underneath, despite saying it was no problem days before.
As this was back in early 2001, I was fortunate that September hadn't come yet, but was still in a pickle since I really liked this rat and was moving across the country, never to return.
SO, my then-gf and I got the airlines to change our tickets for the next day and stayed the night at a hotel, where we planned for our big smuggling adventure.
The next morning, I made sure all metal was off my body (including all piercings, just to be safe), and put on a hoodie that had a pocket on the belly, one of those open-ended things that you can put your hands in when its cold.
I sewed up one end and part of another, put the rat in, and sealed it with a safety pin holding closed the last little bit.
I cut off that hoodie's hood, and put another hoodie on over this.
Checked the mirror, and if I sucked in my gut a bit, one could hardly see the bulge of rat amidst all the other fabric.
Then, I put some clothes in the animal carrier that she was going to be transported in (and that the airlines had told me was ok, just a little cat carrier thing for small animals), and we went to the airport.
We checked our luggage, and then I started the PLAN.
I was already sweaty from wearing the two hoodies in LA, so I had my desired appearance down; from then, it was as simple as pretending to be sick for school.
We approached the security and I went up to one of the guards, saying I felt like I was going to throw up and where was the closest bathroom.
They pointed across the metal detectors, and I turned to my gf and asked her if she could drag all the stuff through.
She said sure, and I took off my belt and watch and put them on the conveyor belt.
I felt it a smart move to leave one or two things on, instead of just briskly walking through, giving off the illusion that I had not planned for this sickness.
This whole time, the rat was in my belly pocket, not having fun.
I concealed it, somewhat, by sucking in my gut for the longest time I've ever had to suck in a gut, and holding my belly as if I was not feeling well.
The plan was executed flawlessly.
I walked through, no alarms, went into the bathroom, waited a little bit, then came out.
Gf had already made it through and was waiting for me.
We walked to our gate and waited for the plane, the whole time trying to consolidate the rat by sneaking bits of cracker into the pocket.
She was not happy and was actively trying to eat her way out.
Once on the plane, I fumbled to get her out (thankfully had a window seat, otherwise other passengers might get some strange ideas (stranger than the ones they must have already had about this sweaty but smiling and happy guy carrying a cat crate)) and stuck her in the carrier, where she quickly burrowed into the clothes I put in there, out of sight.
When someone would ask about the animal in there (as two stewardesses did), we merely said it was a kitten and probably was scared, did not want to come out.
They would look in and see nothing but clothes.
Put the carrier at my feet, ate some peanuts, and not a single fuck was given that day.
That rat ended up living another two years to the ripe old age of 3 and a half.
One day, I heard her squeak really loud, and found her lying on her side.
I picked her up, held her real close to my face, comforted her and said it was all going to be ok, and felt her final tiny little rat breaths against my eyelid.
She was a good rat... *sniff*.

103	"Preface: I lost my father in the 9/11 attacks.
I was 6 years old.
This past September 11th I went to the memorial ceremony in lower Manhattan for the second time (I had gone in, I think 2003, the year they had children of the victims read the names of the deceased at the ceremony).
As you probably remember, around that time there was the whole controversy over the ""Ground Zero mosque"".
Notorious ass Pamela Gellar had a whole big anti-mosque protest going on after the ceremonies that day (I had emailed her at one point pleading for her to call it off- she complimented my writing skills and tried to shove her uberconservative BS down my throat) and my mom decided to go to that.
We had a bunch of pictures of my father around, along with buttons with his face on them, during the ceremony.
Before the day even began, I demanded that those things go home with me- asserting that she had the right to protest but that she didn't have the right to tie my father's name and likeness to such vitriolic bullshit.
The ceremony was nice, went off without a hitch.
After my father's name was read, we made our way away from the main area, and walked around the adjacent blocks towards the WTC site (families were given the opportunity to leave flowers in the ""footprints"" of the towers on that day).
That, also, went off without a hitch.
I was going home with my aunt and uncle, who weren't protesting that day.
Their car was parked at our hotel (the Millennium, right across the street from Ground Zero) so we headed back there.
In front of the hotel, the protest had already begun and the crazies were out in full force.
That anti-Islamic British group (name escaping me at the moment) was there, handing out their literature right in front of the hotel.
Police were around but couldn't do anything, I understand that.
I saw two clergymen talking with a TV reporter nearby about how the mosque project was painful for the 9/11 families and disrespectful to the victims, crap like that.
I was a 15 year old kid and these were older men, religious leaders, but shit I was not willing to leave Manhattan that day without my voice being heard.
I started debating them on the merits of the mosque project.
We were on the sidewalk near the front of the hotel, and people just kept coming and coming.
We were probably pulling a crowd of 50 people near the end and we must have went on for at least an hour and a half.
Most of the crowd was against me.
The clergymen were quite respectful, but besides a well-intentioned but angry twentysomething who agreed with me the ""audience"" reaction was mostly shouts telling me how I was wrong about the points I was making.
We eventually agreed to disagree.
I may not have swayed anyone that afternoon, but I was damn proud of myself for getting my ideas in, and for defending my father's memory and the memories of all the other victims from being linked to exclusionism and hatred.
An Alabama documentary team filmed the whole exchange.
I got their card that day and they sent me a DVD a couple of months back once they had finished editing the footage.
Still have to check it out.

104	"There's a story in my family that is referred to as The Poo Sock.
I was about 10 years old and I lived with my mom, little brother, stepdad, two older stepbrothers, and my stepdad's dad.
One day I went to the bathroom and took a shit.
There was no toilet paper.
I had no idea what to do.
I spent about 20min hollering for someone to help me but no one was home.
Then I saw the sock.
I didn't know whose sock it was, all I knew was that I could wipe my ass with it, so I did.
I then stared horrified at the sock.
*What had I done?
*

The only thing I could think of was to get rid of the sock.
I don't know why I did it, but I hid it behind the toilet.
Maybe I heard someone get home or maybe I was just terrified, I don't know all I know is I did it.
Then I washed my hands and left.
The plan was to return to the scene of the crime in the dead of night while everyone was sleeping and throw out the sock in the construction down the block where they had just knocked down a grain silo.
No one would ever know.
Then my mom found the sock.
That day.
Before I'd even had a chance to get rid of it.
My brother, stepbrothers, and I were sat around the table and then *bam* The Poo Sock was tossed down in the center of the table (on something, not directly on the table, I think it was on a plastic bag or something).
I froze.
I was so horrified that I'd been found out.
My oldest stepbrother was 13 at the time was disgusted.
He made everyone know how he felt and became angered that he was brought into the situation since it was such a disgusting thing to do.
My other stepbrother, 11, and my little brother, 9, were laughing uncontrollably.
I'm talking barely able to breathe with tears running down your face laughter.
There was a shit covered sock on the table and it was comedy gold.
I stared in disbelief at the sock.
I was sure they were going to call me out on it.
After the initial lecture my mom and stepdad apparently decided to go about the ordeal in a rational thinking kind of way.
Who was the least likely person to have wiped their ass with a sock and then shove it behind a toilet?
Not the girl.
I was let off the hook.
Soon, my oldest stepbrother joined me.
The others remained.
It had been over an hour of parents yelling and they *still had not stopped laughing*.
Laughter was equal to guilt, but the problem was that there were two of them laughing.
Eventually my parents gave up and released them.
The sock was thrown out.
It was generally agreed upon that it must have been the elderly gentleman living with us.
No one was going to confront him, that man had had 26 strokes while diving into a pool and was still able to take care of himself!
Let him wipe his damn ass with a sock.
It's been a decade.
No one knows.

105	"Not sure if I'm allowed to do this but this is from a post I made.
Copy pasta.
It was the summer of fourth grade and there was a new kid in the neighborhood.
Lets call him Jack.
Attempting to make the move easier I befriended him.
Over the summer we grew fairly close, I showed him what around town.
We rode bikes through the woods together, played football together and so on.
I went to his house or he would come to mine almost everyday.
It was great.
When school started we shared a seat on the bus and I introduced him to some of my other friends.
I helped him with school work and showed him around.
Eventually he started hanging out with another group of people but we were still fairly close outside of school.
After about a year we had almost entirely stopped hanging out.
We didn't hate each other or anything like that, but we grew apart.
He was hanging with the ""cool"" kids and I was still with my group.
Cut to sixth grade.
I was sitting on the bus again waiting for the next person to get on.
One of his ""cool friends"" says ""Jack you are so awesome, you've changed a lot since fourth grade"" 

""Yea"" says another one of his friends ""you used to be so weird back then!
""

""Ha Ha Yea"" Jack replied
 
Everyone laughed

But I was his friend back then I thought.
I felt pretty shitty.
He ended up staying for a few more years before moving away.
He had a large going away party.
I wasn't invited.

106	"When I was 14 years old, I was in an awkward place in life.
I was an aspie, a tomboy, and my only good friends were for some reason extroverted fashionistas.
One was a guy...he'd been my video game buddy for years but when he came out of the closet, he transformed into a total douche that let me know DAILY that I looked like a lesbian hobo.
The other was a girl I had been best friends with since first grade, and she decided one day that I was holding her back with my apparent disregard for social norms.
She just stopped being friends with me.
I was lonely, depressed, and self-loathing.
So that's the set up.
On some AOL video game message boards, there was this girl.
Her screenname was Samui.
I had a girl-crush, I guess.
She was tomboyish like me, but cool about it, and funny as hell.
Everyone loved her, and I wanted to be her, or at least as cool as her.
Que Aspherger's syndrome:  My response to this was to make up some cool people to be my friends so that people would think I was cool, too.
It made sense at the time.
However, it got WAY out of hand.
I carried the facade into my real life.
I told stories about these people.
They had families, hometowns, friends of their own.
A few had myspaces.
I found out that I am one *fantastic* liar.
People believed me.
Some of my friends developed their own friendships with them and chatted online all the time.
One friend from school even bitched about me to one of them...that's when I got jealous.
**I was jealous of my own imaginary friends.
**

What happened?
They were cooler than me!
They were getting invited to things that I wasn't!
Also, at about this point, I fucked up bigtime and started ""dating"" one of them that ""lived in Yorktown.
""  He was very popular.
Remember that girl who ditched me for not being cool enough?
**She told me to fuck off because she liked him.
** She'd been talking to him with a sceenname that was different from her old one!
I was about to be in my first girl drama!
As proud as I was, HE WASN'T REAL!
Fuck!
So, time to fix things.
I'm a writer, granted a young one at the time, but I had skills.
One imaginary friend commits suicide.
Everyone buys it, he'd been struggling with depression anyway since he'd been living with his brother after their parents' car accident.
Tears were shed, my own parents ask if I want therapy.
I bravely decline.
One by one, I literally wrote these people out of my life.
A couple of the fabrications who were old enough to enlist supposedly did that...I live in a navy area so that wasn't weird to anyone, either.
It was hard work.
I had to do tread carefully so as to not be found out.
Becoming known as the craziest fucking liar to ever live was not something I wanted to do.
I am 21 years old now, and people still ask me how so-and-so is doing.
Please, please understand that I feel guilt to this day over this.
When it started, I was just lonely.
And weirdly enough, making up stories and keeping up with lies helped me learn how people work.
I practically cured my fucking Aspergers with this.
I REGRET NOTHING!
Okay, I regret it a little.
That is so messed up.
Young me was batshit crazy.

107	"Wow ....
I have a similar experience to this.
It was out of character for me to do this but there was an popular online game called Ragnarok.
There's has been multiple free servers and there was one server which I played on it constantly and then one day, i was really bored and I decided to make a girl account.
At first, few days as it went wasn't so bad then people started to hit on me left and right.
Tired of the typical response of, ""sorry, I am a guy"" then it would be followed by ""eww, you fag!
"" or ""why are you playing as a girl?!
"" or whatever.
I decided to make up an identity behind the girl characters, I was known as Jeanette ""Janie"" Southsworth to the players.
As I played more, the more popular I get and I do not know why.
I guess it was because I had good gears and i played good and so on but I was known as the Good Chick.
Some people even went as far to ask my e-mail which I quickly created one up at AOL.
It was one of those typical girly e-mails like, ""RagnarokBarbieXOXO"" so I gave it out to the guys who asked.
It then progressed to them asking for some pictures so I just did a quick google search and find the one at very last few pages to not arose some suspicions and emailed them.
As a result, I get ""OMG!
YOU R SO HAWT!
I FAPPED!
"" .
I was a little creeped out but i brushed it off since it wasn't technically a picture of me that they fapped to.
So few months went by and I received my first nude picture from a guy.
That was when I knew I just had to stop but there was a fanbase based on Janie so I started to pretend that Janie was too busy to focus on the game, too much schoolwork, have to take care of her new twin sisters named Bella and Eliza, then I gradually made her have to ditch the game to focus on her schoolwork so she can go to a college.
I got SO many e-mails saying for Janie not to abandon it, it wrecks my heart because I have made some good friends through her but i just had to let it go once I realized that they were just her online friends and they would forget about her as soon as a new girl show up in the game.
I never went back to playing it.

The morning rolls around for me to leave and it's a weekday morning.

About 15 minutes into my drive deadlocked in Chi town morning traffic my stomachs starts burgling.
Apparently spicy carnitas are like liquid drano to my bowls.

Pretty soon I'm clenching so hard I'm fucking planking face up in my car while driving.
I finally make it off the highway and all I see is a Home Depot and a movie theatre close to each other.

I pull into a parking space and start my sprint into HD with stomach at a level 4 meltdown and then it happens..... Me a grown fucking man......SHIT MYSELF.
At this point I couldn't go into HD I had shit running down my pants legs into my shoes and I smelled like carnita death.
Only thing I could do was get back into my car and drive around to figure out what to do.
I went behind the movie theater and found that no one was back there.
Got out my shitmobile and finished releasing carnita death on the snow with just a t-shirt and shoes on.
I grabbed another old t shirt from my bag and cleaned my self up with that.
Changed into some clean clothes OUTSIDE, left my clothes and hopped back into the shitmobile.
The smell was horrid in my car, no shit got on my seat but the smell was stuck in my car.

110	"During my senior year of high school we took an educational class trip to Italy during spring break.
One night we were staying in Anzio and for some reason there only seemed to be one bar open in the area which obviously we were hanging out at.
My friends, myself, a British guy and an Australian guy (both of whom claimed to be friends) were the only people in the bar.
They seemed like pretty cool guys and we hung out with them for a while until everyone decided we should move the party down to a disco club a couple blocks away.
Most of the group headed out and started walking down to the club, but 4 of my friends stayed back talking to the Brit and Aussie.
I was pretty tanked and getting tired so decided to return to the hotel instead of going to club.
On my way back to the hotel, this car drives passed me and my friend John who stayed back at the bar was hanging out the window drunkenly yelling ""Wooo!
Altomatum!
Yeeeaaahhhh!
"" as if he was on a rollercoaster or something.
I was like what the fuck are they doing in a random car in Anzio?
When I got back to the hotel I called John to make sure he was alright and he said they had gotten a ride from one of the guys from the bar.
I said okay good, be careful.
The next morning John and his roommate never came out of their room.
I got nervous and started beating on their door to wake them up, but no answer.
So I went to my balcony climbed over to their room next door and luckily let myself in through the unlocked balcony door.
I had to shake the two guys to get them to wake up.
I asked them what happened last night and they couldn't remember a thing.
The two girls they were with however, remembered everything and told us how one of the guys from the bar bought the girls each a martini, but the girls refused them saying the didn't like martinis.
So John and the other guy naturally saw this as free drinks and quickly downed them.
After a while, they decided it was time to leave so the guy with the car offered to drive them back to the hotel which they accepted.
The mood changed when they realized they were traveling in the opposite direction of the hotel.
Having told the guy driving about this, he said nothing and started to speed up.
They told him to stop and let them out but he refused and kept speeding up.
They started kicking at the back windows and threatening to kill the guy if he didn't pull over and let them out, so he finally stopped and let them go.
They had no idea where they were and somehow managed to walk what they figured was 3-4 miles back to the hotel.
We came to the conclusion that the guy slipped something in the martinis intending to drug the girls.
The same night one of my other friends decided instead of going to the club he wanted to stay back and smoke.
He managed to meet a stranger on the street who took him to some house outside the city so he could buy some hash.
He bought the hash and was able to safely return to the hotel.
For some reason I expected his story to be a little crazier, but that was about it.
My only regret was that I pussed out by not going to the club and could've been a part of one of those stories.

Most people don't like the KKK, me included, but you'd use a KKK bleach.

Because that shit would work.

114	"**FINALLY** 

When I was in the 8th grade my mother decided that I needed to start eating breakfast.
It was always offered, but I never wanted to eat in the morning because I have a weird digestive track and still to this day, eating food in the morning makes my stomach hurt.
Well, she thought it would be a great idea to get Smores flavored Poptarts.
What more could a kid want, right?
Chocolate for breakfast!
Anyways, one morning I was already not feeling good, my stomach had been cramping since I woke up.
However, this did not stop my mother on insisting that I eat these poptarts.
So I did.
As soon as I took that first bite, I felt the shit in my stomach start brewing and boiling like Ol' Faithful in a coke bottle.
I was ready to spew.
Now, my school was 25 miles from my house, and the only gas stations were about halfway there.
There are two gas stations at this halfway point.
One is really shitty, and the other one is really nice.
You pass the shitty gas station first, when coming from my house.
Anyways, I told my mom to pull over immediately when we got to the first gas station.
I'm clenching my cheeks are tight as I can when we roll up.
I jump out of the car into the gas station, looked the clerk dead in the eye and asked where the bathrooms were, then he point to the back of the store.
I rushed down the isle as fast as I could.
Right when I was about to open the bathroom door, the knob turned and out walked this enormous beast of a man.
He looked like Santa Claus after a night of hookers and cocaine.
His face was red and tiny beads of sweat puddled off his bald head into his eye sockets.
I didn't care.
This was the worst I've ever had to shit.
I ran into the bathroom, pulled down my pants and before my ass could even touch the warm (yes, it was still warm) seat, shit was spewing out of my anus.
I was relieved and luckily it was just one large gush, rather than an ongoing stream.
I breathed in relief.
I looked over for the toilet paper, but there was none there.
I looked for some paper towels, but there was none there.
Under the sink?
Nothing.
I had no idea what I was going to do.
I was stuck in here, sitting on a warm toilet, with nothing to wipe with.
I didn't panic though.
I stayed calm.
Then, like a sign from god I looked behind me, and up hung on the wall was a framed letter that read ""If the bathroom fails to meet expectations, please notify management.
"" I pulled this down, took the back off, and wiped my ass with the letter.
Afterwards I hung it back up, and walked out, never to go in that gas station ever again.

We got bored and decided we were going to put up a lemonade stand.
Only one problem - we couldn't find the sugar.
She called her mom and told her it was on the counter.
We found it but it was only really enough for one pitcher, so I rode my bike down to the store to grab some more.
She makes the first pitcher with the stuff on the counter.
Says it's bubbling as she mixes it but I say it's probably the air in the pipes making those bubbles.
Get back, start setting up the stand and we get our first customer - the ice cream truck guy!
Awesome.
We give him his drink and he takes a sip.
Instantly makes a face and tells us we must have used salt instead of sugar - it was nasty.
He leaves and we just assume he's a weird dude.
Keep on going.
Some kids from down the street set up another lemonade stand and stop over.
We had a few different favors so they buy a couple drinks from us and start drinking.
The kid says that the one kind is nasty but it's good when mixed with another one we had (one that was made with the sugar I bought).
He finishes his drink and leaves.
At the end of the day her parents are on their way home so we start packing up and heading inside.
Her mom enters the kitchen and asks us why we didn't do our lemonade stand.
We said we did.
She says well where did you get the sugar from and picks up a package of sealed sugar off the counter.
We are confused.
She told her we used the stuff of the counter like she said - the sugar that was in the plastic baggie.
She starts laughing at us and says that was laundry detergent.

I was not told that I was being sent there, it was easy for them to deceive me because we actually had a relative in the same hospital who we visited before hand.
So we walk into this reception area through large double doors, my mom goes and talks to the guy there, then all the sudden the lady behind the counter offered me a lollipop.
I don't say no to lollipops.
Got it nearly to my mouth, looked back, most of my family is backing through the doors.
I scream, start bawling hystericly, and run full force at those doors.
They were remotely locked.
So I decided to headbutt the orderly in the groin and make a mad dash for the pencils.
I thought that if I had a weapon, I had leverage.
I succeeded in headbutting the guy, but it nearly knocked me out.
Apparently they wore cups.
So, the guy not down, I took a flying leap towards his face.
Then I learned why being that young sucks.
Picked my ass up and held me out.
Then he took me to a room and out me in a strait-jacket sort of thing, only I was on the floor and couldn't get up.
I remember thrashing around in it for an hour, then finally feeling my whole finger go through one of the Velcro straps, only for them to come over and readjust the whole thing.
After that shit gets a little foggy, but I remember one orderly who gave out biscuits with milk.
It pissed me off, made me feel like a prisoner (which I was), and so I stabbed him in the ankle with a broken off crayola pencil.
That was more time in the jacket, then I had to share a bed with some girl who had apparently never learned to control her bladder.
Joy.

I lived with two guys, one of which was 21.
I was 19 at the time.
Anywho my girlfriend and a bunch of other people are over and we get wasted and whatnot.
Girlfriend and I go to bed at like 5am to do whatever.
Sometime that morning girlfriend wakes me up wanting to go out and get cigs.
I was in no condition to walk let alone drive so I mumble a no and promptly pass back out.
All of a sudden I'm being shaken awake by girlfriend who looks panicked.
She says some dude stole my car and crashed it into something.
I'm still barely coherent but I soldier and get dressed and stumble outside.
I look at the car and one of the front headlights is fucked up but by and large no real damage.
Girlfriend is still in a panic and cuts herself on the headlight.
By this time one of my roommates is out there as well and I tell him to take care of her cut while I look at the car.
All of a sudden I wake up again (yes I passed out on the ground in front of my car.
) to see a cop looking down at me from his squad car.
He starts asking me if this is my car and if I knew anything about it being crashed into an ATM outside of my local gas station (btw my gas station was in walking distance and I never drove there unless I needed gas).
He asks me to come with him to be identified at the gas station, I said ok and I got my first and only trip in the back of a squad car.
We get to the gas station and the people there say it wasn't me.
We go back to my apartment and the cop starts asking me about my girlfriend, who I figured now that I was somewhat sober had taken my car to get more smokes and had crashed it.
At my apartment I find out that the girlfriend had bailed and was running around somewhere in a town she wasn't really familiar with.
The cops look around the apartment a little, luckily my other roommate hid the 4ft bong we had before they came in.
They do a check on my girlfriend and tell me she basically has a record already.
They tow my car and tell me I can come get it when I'm sober and I pay a ticket.
The cops finally tell me and my roommates to call if she shows back up.
Sure enough she walks back after like an hour.
We convince her to turn herself in and the cops come and pick her up.
Me being a broke as fuck 19yr old need my parents help in getting my car back which means I have to tell them an edited version of the above.

Then, we ended up having a 4/5 hour straight back and forth texting frenzy.
After that, we probably talked every day and I could tell she was really into me.
She opened up to me.
She told me about her Russian, immigrant parents who died and left her the family business; one that she successfully ran while in college.
About scars, physical and emotional, that were left from her few years on earth.
I told her half-truths, and since I lived a couple states away, I never thought it would come back to haunt me.
One afternoon, ""Jane"" didn't answer a text.
I tried later on in the evening and she answered.
She described to me about how she was just in the hospital after having an altercation with her Ex.
She told me in haunting detail about how they were yelling at eachother and it eventually led to him punching Jane in the face...a couple time.
""He just kept hitting me..."" It still gives me cold shivers down my spine to this day.
Here was MY lady, three states away, in complete emotional turmoil.
I tried to be as understanding and helpful as I could.
And somewhere along the line, it went wrong.
To this day, I can't remember what I said.
All I know is that it ended in her saying ""You know what.
Don't ever talk to me again.
You're horrible.
"" That is something she has stuck to for over a year now.
Every now and then, I text the number.
I hope that one day she'll want to talk to me again.
Or that she will want to be my wife and ride unicorns with me across the universe.
But that hasn't happened yet.
The first meaningful, loving relationship I've had with a woman vanished into thin air through a simple, little text message.
So, iPlaybunny, or should I say, Regina, if you are out there reading this, just know that I loved you.
Truly.
I know I was a bit of an a-hole, but you will always have a place in my heart.

124	"1,0000 comments, this will never get seen, and I've posted it before, but here goes: the epically Superbad-esque story of me losing my virginity.
Hopefully my ex-girlfriend doesn't Reddit.
So, this is senior year of high school.
There's this girl (we'll call her ""Kim"") who I've been kind of interested in for a while, but she had a boyfriend and I was by no means a player, so I just kind of didn't really follow it up.
I later found out she had broken up with her bf a couple months ago.
So, I'm at a party and Kim's there, and I had ended up pinned down, lying down in the rain while a cop car with a searchlight on top scanned the field (long story.
Basically, cops chased us thinking we were some vandals who had been in the area, when really we were fairly innocent.
However, we fled like idiots anyway, and got pinned down in a dark field for over 45 minutes while cops searched the area for us).
Anyway, we eventually escape, and I get back to the house where the party is, and begin to drink.
A lot, to calm my nerves.
Bad idea.
I end up getting really hammered, and Kim and I get to talking about how I was caught in the rain.
Drunken me slurs something along the lines of, ""Whatever, I actually really like the rain, so it's not that big a deal.
"" She claims to love the rain, too, so we decide to go stand in the rain because we're drunk and it seems like a good idea.
We get outside, only to find that it's STOPPED RAINING.
Fuck you, God.
We turn to go back inside, disappointed, and I bust out this drunken gem: ""You know what else is like rain, but is warm?...the shower.
""

Kim agrees that this is indeed a good idea.
We get into the shower, and I have no idea how to handle it.
Leave my clothes on?
Take off all my clothes but my underwear?
Take off my underwear?
We start fully clothed, but lose our outer clothes almost immediately and take off everything but our underwear, and here's the kicker.
I AM WEARING SUPERMAN BOXERS.
This is because I was very naive in high school, and moral me wanted to keep my virginity until college (by the way, I was a virgin at the time.
Very important.
Remember this).
Basically, I wore those boxers out whenever I partied (which wasn't too often or anything) as a last-ditch cock-block attempt in case I was too drunk to fend off any girls.
Of course, never before had I had a girl throw herself at me when I was drunk, but good to be cautious, right?
You never know what happens at these parties.
Well, I'm in my boxers in the shower, and Kim's in a bra and panties in the shower (also, she is hot.
Important point.
Not drop-dead gorgeous, but she's attractive.
Also, she has an amazing body).
She takes off her underwear in the shower, and I get a pretty quick boner, so, what the hell, I take off my boxers, too.
Now I'm standing there in the shower with a boner with her.
Normally, I'd be mortified, but I'm still really hammered, so I don't really care.
Kim starts making out with me.
We start basically trying to have sex while making out in the shower, but I'm a virgin and have no idea about the mechanics of how to actually initiate sex or anything, and also she's quite a bit shorter, so it's impractical.
So we get out of the shower, laughing at our pathetic failure, and go to the washing machine in the corner of the bathroom.
She hops up on it and we start trying to fuck on that.
It doesn't work, either.
I'm too inexperienced and too drunk to maintain my balance, although I hide it pretty well.
We put our underwear on and go upstairs to a bedroom.
Thank christ we didn't see anyone on the way.
When we get there, Kim throws me on the bed, pulls off my Superman boxers, and begins to go down on me.
She then gets on top of me, in nothing but panties, and asks me ""If I'm sure I'm okay with this.
"" I actually laughed, I was so drunk.
Of course I was okay with this.
Are you kidding me?
We talk about condoms - I have one in my wallet, but it's in the next room, where the other 15-20 kids are.
I don't know this girl well, so it would be weird if we went in, grabbed the condom, waved, and left.
So we just do it sans condom - we've established she's on the pill and neither of us have a disease.
So we start fucking, changing every five-ten minutes or so from her on top to me bending her over the bed and doing her doggy style.
Obviously, I was worried about coming too soon, but I was still hammered as shit, so it was actually fine.
I distinctly remember doing her from behind while she was moaning and drunkenly thinking, ""Uh-oh.
If I don't come soon, Kim's gonna get bored.
"" So, with a Herculean effort, I finish.
All those years of vehemently protecting my v-card, and after one drunken night it's gone.
The best part is that we then walked back in to the room, with our still-sopping-wet clothes (from the shower) on, and try to play it off like nothing happened.
Everyone knew.
Including the girl in there who I had dated several months earlier.
Luckily, she was friends with Kim, too, and apparently she had predicted to Kim that Kim would take my virginity on prom night, so her only response was ""I told you so.
"" (I ended up dating the girl I slept with that night for the next five months.

Being only 6 years old, Id never done any kind of golfing before, so I only knew what Id always seen in movies or on TV: guys swinging it back and forth a few times before bringing it way back and up and then whacking the eff out of the ball.
Nevermind that a few kids went before me and I watched them hit.
Thats how I thought it was done.
So, it gets to be my turn.
The birthday boys older sister (maybe 13; also my babysitter) was standing pretty close behind me.
Guess what I did?
I whacked the *shit* out of her face.
She screamed, her nose bled everywhere and I think I may have broken it.
I immediately started bawling and I think some adult yanked the club out of my hands.
I will never get over that embarrassment, but in retrospect, chick shouldnt have been standing so close.

133	"When I was twelve, my parents got me a baby green garden snake for my birthday.
I named the little guy Salazar, for obvious reasons.
He was awesome.
All green and smooth and he had these kick-ass snake eyes.
He used to slither all over, wrap around my arm, spit white shit on our furniture.
Snake stuff.
A couple weeks later, I walked over to his terrarium to give him his morning meal, to find Salazar in a twisted *S* shape, mouth open, stiff as a twig.
He was pretty fucking dead.
Upon closer inspection (trying to see through the hot tears erupting from my eyes), I realized the little guy had fangs.
Not normal snake teeth, serious business fangs.
It turns out my best bud in the world was a baby Green Mamba, who had been picked up by accident in Florida (he'd somehow been blown or shipped there in the confusion of a recent hurricane), and then sent to my home state of Cali.
Green Mambas are some of the most venomous, dangerous snakes in the world.
The white shit he'd been spitting (and I never really bothered to look into it, though it had always worried me) was venom, and *shit*.
I regret his death, and miss him dearly to this very day, so many years later.
But I'm glad he didn't kill my entire family, all of our other pets, and me.
RIP in our front garden until the end of times, Salazar Short-lived.
:(

(edit grammms and also the reason he died is because we weren't feeding him correctly.
Green mambas don't eat dead crickets or snake pellets, they eat live animals...)

My girlfriend, who lived in Alabama, was staying with me.
Because the hurricane had knocked all of the power out, we had no air conditioning.
Trying to sleep in Florida in the middle of summer without air conditioning, is an almost impossible task.
Well, impossible for her since I was doing fine.
Around 1:00am she woke me up and said she couldn't sleep due to the heat.

142	"After moose hunting last year, my father brought me to investigate a black bear den.
Earlier in the day, he had gone to closely inspect the den solo.
Mind you, this was after watching the bear walk about 2 km/1 mile away into a clear cut (recently forested area).
When we arrived there it was roughly 4:30pm, and my father hadn't seen the bear in that area for about six hours.
With confidence, we approached the den.
It's amazing how complacency can turn a serene moment into a terrifying one.
My father had his rifle in an 'at-the-ready' over his waist, while mine was still lazily slung behind my shoulder.
My father looked into the den opening from about five feet away, and I thought he said ""You can see him right in there.
*insert slight grin*.
""  He did not say the word ""him"" in that sentence.
I moved to where my father was standing and leered into the den, while he did a quick binocular-scan of the horizon for any moose/wildlife.
What looked out of the den at me were two bright yellow-brown eyes, and a soft snout.
You may be thinking ""SO WHY THE FUCK WERE YOU STILL THERE?
"", but what you have to realize is that my father is one of the most sterotypical Canadians you'll meet.
Anything nature related is his area of expertise, and this fact gave me a false sense of security.
I casually turn away from the den to follow my father back to our respective posts, and this is the moment when the Pretty Eyed pooh-bear decided it should leave the den.
Black bears make this thunderous noise by slamming all their weight onto their front paws, in an attempt at intimidation.
This noise was indeed intimidating, as well as the first moment that clued my father in to the bear's presence.
While I was still turning around, my father had his rifle drawn and ready to fire should it advance any closer.
5 feet is what separated the two of us from this beast.
It only took about two seconds for the bear to turn and run full speed in the opposite directions, but I felt every primal instinct kick in during that period.
As if somebody had just sneezed, my father asked ""You ok?
"" then casually started to walk back towards his post.

144	"So I totally deserved this but shit it was awesome/fucking terrifying.
I had hooked up with a girl (who we'll call Sasha) who lived out of town (2 hrs away) and when we went to visit she kept on complaining about her ex-boyfriend (the, don't put a crazy dick in you type).
They had been broken up for 9 months and he *still* kept tabs on her and got really jealous of all her boyfriends.
Being a complete troll I began texting him from her phone (with her permission) basically antagonizing him telling him that 'she was busy getting fucked from behind so she couldn't text'.
Yeah.
Not nice.
I'm evil.
Feed me downvotes.
I hadn't even actually had sex with her.
Fingered but no penis.
Anyways one thing escalates to another and we decide to drive over to his house and just drive by for the thrill of it.
We are in a yellow VW Beetle that a friend of Sasha's had.
She drove standard which made it cooler.
But what would happen next made me forever love beetles, and the girl who was driving it even more.
Us driving bye royally pissed off this guy (with good reason).
When we were gone, he texted my friend (Trevor) saying a bunch of psycho shit, like 'I wanna play hide and seek ;)'.
Turns out his friend had a Suburban and they were out driving the town looking for us.
This was not a big town, and they eventually found us.
They began tailgating us and forcing us to speed up.
We were driving down a dirt road and they pulled up on the other side of the yellow line and tried to run us off the road.
GTA had prepared me.
I yelled HIT THE BREAKS!
We slowed and they zoomed by us.
We pulled into a storage unit type parking lot but they looped back ridiculously fast and found us again.
We continued trying to escape and we drove into a subdivision with pretty wide streets.
They speed in front of us, and we think they are leaving.
Nope.
They pull a sharp u-turn and begin *driving backwards* in a come-at-me-bro fashion.
At this point somebody else sees whats occurring and calls the cops.
I'm on the phone with my other friend (who was getting laid at the time) saying how fucking crazy this guy is.
We pull into a side street and lose the guys.
When we go back to Sasha's house her lights are off but her front door is wide fucking open and nobody is home.
I still don't have an explanation for that, but the crazy ex wasn't there (at least when we arrived).
Me and my buddy (who was in the beetle with me) reconvene at Tim Horton's with our getting lucky friend.
We get the fuck out of town, and Trevor is still getting texts from the guy basically apologizing and saying he was joking about trying to legitimately fucking kill us.
The smilies he used were especially chilling.
Last laugh had by me: I went back a few months later and actually did have sex with her in the back of my car.
I didn't tell the dude about it.

When I was around 20, a few years ago, I kept having dreams about a woman with long black hair named Aroura [ pronounced A-roar-uh) .
They were different dreams but for some reason, her distinct face and name always ended up in them.
It got to the point where I would wake up frustrated and confused, trying to google her name or find out how I was connected to her.
After a few months she stopped showing up and I dismissed it, thinking my brain was just being a ""scumbag.
"" 

Fast forward a few years later, Halloween 2009, I'm in the car with a friend stopped at a gas station.
I'm about to pull out and merge onto a highway when I get a phone call from a random number, so I stop the car but no one answered.
There was a person behind me who grew impatient, honked at me, and then swerved in front of me instead of waiting for 2 seconds for me to move.
Second they get on the highway, some silver civic loses control of their wheel and crashes into the car that swerved in front of me.
I called the cops and waited at the gas station for them to come.
Turns out the drivers of both cars died.
It 100% would of been me if I hadn't of got that phone call.
Called it back a few hours later out of gratitude and curiosity, rang 3 times and went to voicemail.
""Hi, you've reached aurora, please leave your name and number.
"" Never had goosebumps like that in me life.
Called it again the next day, because I was that confused about the whole situation..
Some woman answers, we get to talking, I tell her my entire story including the dreams I had.
She tells me she doesn't know how I got her number and that she never called me as far as she remembers.
Weird.
Ask her if she has a facebook to confirm if she is in fact the woman in my dreams.
Check her facebook, holy fuck, it's her.
If that's not a glitch in the matrix then I'm just bat shit crazy.

The parallel universe answering machine:

This happened about 15 years ago.
I called my friend up and he wasn't home so I left a message on his answering machine.
I said, ""Hey, it's me KILLALLEXTREMISTS.
Sorry I missed you, call you later.
Bye.
"" And then I hung up and left the house.
I made no other calls.
Later that day he called back and he says, ""Wow, that was quite a message you left.
Who was that girl you were talking to?
"" I was like, ""What are you talking about?
I wasn't talking to any girl!
"" Well, as it turns out the message didn't end after I said ""Bye"".
I had to go over to his house and listen to this message a few times.
After my initial message that I did leave (as quoted above) there was a slight pause and it continues on for another 30-40 seconds or so with me talking to some girl.
It was my voice, but a conversation I never had with a girl whose voice I didn't recognize.
You could compare it to the message I know I did leave and the two voices were indistinguishable.
Not just the voice but, you know, talking mannerisms.
It was my voice.
Also, references to my occupation and activities were the same.
Basically, in this conversation I was talking to this girl about going skiing but I had to go down to my shop and work on a car first, which totally correlated to me.
Then the message just stopped.
It was recorded on one of those digital answering machines that recorded the message to a chip so there was no tape I could have taken and had analyzed, unfortunately.
Also, neither I nor my friend had party lines so that's not an explanation.
It was very freaky, I can't explain it.

This up set her greatly and against the wishes of the rest of the family (due to cost) she went and got his body and had it moved to the US.
With in days of getting him home, the wall went up.

Of course I'll preface this with the usual ""I'm not a superstitious or generally spiritual person"" but...
In high school I was in the drumline, and we usually practiced early in the morning prior to school starting.
We were inside the bandroom that day because it was fairly cold.
So anyway, I'm doing my thing, playing the tenors (toms for the layman) and I drop one of my mallets.
I turn to pick it up and I can't find it...
There is about ten feet of open bare floor surrounding me and nowhere to be found.
My instructor stops us and basically just asks me what the problem is.
So several of us start searching around, can't find it.
I say screw it and grab a spare set.
About twenty mins later, the band director walks in, unlocks his office, sits at his desk and knocks on the window, I look up and he picks up the mallet off his desk with a look like, ""what is this doing in here?
"" I could verify that it was mine because I marked each set.
Nobody had gone in or out, no gap under the door, locked room, ended up on the desk.
There were 15 of us in the room at that time and there was a unanimous ""NOPE!!!!!!

I was stunned and one of my buddies came unglued.
We pretty much canceled the rest of rehearsal right there and many of us were pretty bugged about it the rest of the day.
I couldn't concentrate on anything for almost a week after that.
Eventually my brain just filed it away under ""unsolved mysteries"" and I went on with life.
TL:DR - Playing drums, dropped stick, (edit: ""it"") ended up in a locked room.

157	"My story:

When I was 13 a doctor wrote me an adult dose for a certain medicine based on my weight.
I was a fat kid.
Our body does not work that way and the medicine ended up constipating me...for a month.
I did not shit for a whole month.
I got sick.
I had racoon-like eyes, my stomach would jump or flutter by itself, I had cramps, etc.
It was bad.
I was miserable.
I finally told my parents how long it had been since i had shit and they freaked out and took me to the hospital.
There, they gave 3 enemas back to back.
After the third and final one, all that water softened all that shit up just enough i could expel it.
I ran to the nearest bathroom, gown open in the back, and tried to make it to the toilet.
I didn't

My ass was hovering at a 45 degree angle above the toilet when the geyser burst.
This next part is not a lie, but i know some of you will think it is, I got shit everywhere.
On the ceiling (somehow), on the floor, the toilet was covered, the walls, even the sink got hit with some spray.
Shit was literally, yes literally, sprayed on all walls and ceiling.
It was everywhere.
I felt like a new kid after that.
Cleaned myself up the best i could and then had to figure out what to do.
There was no way i could clean it all up, I needed a janitor.
So I walked out and politely told a nurse the bathroom need a clean up and badly.
A janitor was only a few rooms down for some reason so I saw him go by to clean it, but he did not know who i was, he got to the bathroom and the whole ER heard, ""Oh Hell no, I ain't cleaning this up.
I quit.
"" and he did.
I felt so bad, still do.
I made some poor janitor quit his job over a shit-caked bathroom.

It was a nice Friday morning and they had come up with this silly plan to do a drive-by mooning of some ""popular girls"".
( No doubt to impress) They had done this before so they had a rehearsed plan.
As they proceeded to pull closer to the girls, the driver honks his horn as the passenger drops his pants and sticks his ass all the way out the window.
The passenger felt a nice fart welling up inside at this time, so he decided it would be extra funny to turn this into a drive-by gassing.
He executed with precision timing.
Here is where it all goes wrong.
The previous day was Senior Ditch Day and he spent much of the previous day consuming copious ammounts of alcohol, apparently passing out a number of times.
So when he ""let 'er rip"" it was not a bubble of gas he was releasing, so-much-as a torrent of bile and fecal matter, in the form of a geyser.
From five feet away at eye level, he had unleashed 24pk o' shit and hosed the girls.
While the first escaped with little damage, the two other girls had taken direct hits.

164	"Similar story to OPs, and comes by way of my friend, who was an X-ray tech at the time.
Two guys come in to the hospital, one of them with a vibrator rammed in his ass.
As the doctors are figuring out what to do, the other guy is sort of whining about cramps he has too.
He's complaining, but being evasive, so it seems like he's trying to be an attention whore.
One of the docs tells my friend to run an X-ray to shut him up.
The X-ray done, my friend is standing behind this little curtain separating her from the patient and trying to process what she is seeing.
There are three perfect ovals in his bum.
As she tells it, it hits her and she lets out this surprised, ""OH.
MY.
GOD.
""  

They were hard-boiled eggs.
The guy starts giggling sheepishly.
She said they used something that dissolved them to get them out.
BONUS for the straight guys/gals.
Later, she said, med personnel are talking about the weirdest things they've seen in the ER.
One doc says a guy comes in bleeding profusely at the groin and the girl with him is bleeding from the top of her head.
Couldn't figure out how the hell these injuries came about.
Turns out, they were at a restaurant and the girl crawls under the table to blow the guy.
She has a seizure and clamps down on his manhood, all while her head is bucking against the top of the table.

I'd never masturbated in my life before this point (I was 18) and really didn't know what to expect.
It was at a friends 18th, so we were all getting pretty drunk and by some miracle of the divines, I was chatting up a chick WAAAAYYY out of my league, and convinced her to go into another room with me.
The lights were off when we went in, and we didn't care about doing it in the dark so we just shut the door and headed in the general direction of the bed.
(We could just see the bed from the light when we opened the door)
Being my first time, I didn't last very long, couldn't have been more than a minute tops.
My dick started to 'hurt' so I pulled out and started to jizz over the bed, but having no idea what was going on and not being able to see, led me to believe that I'd broken my penis and was shooting blood everywhere, and I started crying.
THEN we hear this coughing from the bed, and oh fuck.
Though I didn't realise this for another minute or so, it turns out we had walked into my friend's parents room.
They had earmuffs on to sleep through the party, so they didn't hear us come in and slept through our first minute of 'sex'.
But I had managed to jizz *all over* the dad's face.
And he woke up, switched on a bedside lamp, to stare dumbly at two half naked teenagers standing beside the bed, frozen in fear, and opened his mouth to speak before realising it was covered in semen.
He shouted at us and kicked us out of the house, and my friend got a ton of shit from them too.
We're still mates, and his mum thinks it's a hilarious story, but his dad still hates me.

They charged me with attempted manslaughter and assault with a deadly weapon.

172	"Several years ago (1998/99) I (male) was about 20 years old and worked with a girl that was a year or two older than me.
We became close friends and had a 'friends with benefits' situation.
One of the things I really liked about her was that she was very socially mature.
She didn't play the drama games that a lot of girls at our age.
She was very honest and kind of told things how they were.
One night after the bar, we ended up back at her place and had a long, drunken discussion.
She was from [location deleted](moved to my state in recent years) and had some meathead brothers (Jersey shore type).
She confided in me she lost her virginity to her brother's friend when she was 14.
She told the story matter of factly and didn't show much emotion.
I was angrier than she was.....

Their parents were out of town and her brothers were having a party.
One of her brother's friends was feeding her tequila (she had never drank before) until she passed out.
She briefly woke up alone in a guest bedroom, blacked out again.
Woke up again and the guy is there and he's kissing her.
She had a crush on him, so she started kissing him back.
...passed out.
Came to again and her pants are around her knees and he is holding her legs up, having sex with her.
She tried to resist, but wasn't able to put up much of a fight....she passed out again.
The next time she woke up, he was gone and her pants were still around her knees.
She staggered to the bathroom and discovered that she was bleeding from her vagina and had semen in her ass.
Her vagina and ass were so sore she couldn't sit for a week.
I go into such detail, because this is how she told it to me.
And I want you to understand how angry I was.
Although we were not in a relationship, we were very good friends (still are), and I was seeing red after hearing this story.
I felt like I was capable of murder.
This guy was a couple of states away and I figured I could pull it off and it would seem totally random.
After a couple of weeks of trying to identify this guy, I had no luck.
I managed to get her brother's phone number from her phone.
I called him, told him that I was a close friend of his sister's but it was important that she didn't know we talked.
I told him the situation and asked if he could identify the guy.
He got really quiet and almost eerily angry.
He said something like ""I fucking know EXACTLY who it is.
"" Apparently he was able to connect some dots somewhere.
(Remember this was 7 or 8 years after the fact).
He said something like ""I'll handle this.
Thank you for calling me.
Now lose this fucking number.
"" and hung up.
Suddenly my anger seemed to pale in comparison to this fucking guy.
Even though I was ready for murder, I almost felt guilty for unleashing this guy's rage.
It turned out it was his best friend from when they were small children.
About two weeks later, my friend said she had to go back home because a friend of the family had died in a jet ski accident.
When she told me the story after work, she said her brother was there and saw the whole thing (they rode jet skis together all the time).
My stomach was in knots...was this the right guy?
Then she said it... ""remember when I told you about how I lost my virginity?
"" ...""yeah"" ...""it was that guy.
"" Fuck yeah.
My only regret in the whole thing is that not everyone knows the back story.
I wish this could be an example to all of the frat house rapists out there that take advantage of young ladies.
It's good to remember that every female out there belongs to someone.
As a father of two daughters...they belong to me.
I am their protector, and will remain so until I give their hand in marriage.
If you fuck with young ladies, you have no idea the level of rage you can unleash in their protectors.

She had self-afflicted bruises/cut marks and had been having consensual sex for almost 2 years at that point, which was somewhat common knowledge amongst both families.
She eventually cracked and confessed to an investigator that she'd only done it because if she couldn't have me anymore, then I couldn't have anyone else ever.

At a young age, probably 6,7 I was exposed to sex very early in terms of incest (an Ask reddit thread is never complete without an incest post.
:D).
So when I was 8 things stopped incest wise, but I was still curious at 10 so when my mom's friend came over with her son I tried stuff on the son, we played a game, if I catched him I would play with his penis, I caught him many times.
At 14 I became friends with my neighbor and I kind of got with his 10 year old sister, fingered her, she fingered herself in front of me.
I've told one person about this and he called me a pedo I said I was young and didn't know what I was thinking, but I think that's a lie.
At 18 I planned to kill my father and this dick at school who the majority hated.
Plan for my father was poisoning, I decided that poisoning wasn't the way to go and he needed to suffer, so I put a pin in it.
With the other guy I planned on killing him by slitting his throat late at the end of the day at school, since there would hardly be anyone around.
So around 4 he was walking to the locker room i was following him, he entered and i entered and I immediately grabbed his head and smashed it against the wall, he was still awake but disoriented, I took out a knife ready to slit his throat but then I heard people walking and talking, I got scared and blitzed out of there.
He never saw who did it luckily.
I am better now, haven't seen that guy in months and I am over my dad.

175	"I had a plan to kill my mother but I never went through with it.
The story is she was a heroin addict that cleaned up her life and had actually become a drug and alcohol counselor when I went to live with her when I was 14.
By the time I was 16, she had started to abuse prescription drugs and our relationship was getting increasingly more abusive.
She would keep me up at night being loud and high.
Sometimes she'd wake me up at random times to cry and tell me she wanted to die, that her life was miserable, and apologize for being such a shitty mom.
Then in the morning, she would grab me by the ankle and pull me out of bed, yelling the whole time about how stupid I was and how ungrateful I was and how I was such a terrible kid.
Looking back, it was a textbook abuse.
One second she was telling me she was the only person who actually loved me, then next tearing me down, telling me I wasn't worth anything, that I shouldn't go to college.
She tried to convince me not to go to school, or work or to hang out with my friends.
She threw things at me, shoved me around, and would block the door when I tried to leave the room rather than fight with her.
After months of escalating behavior, not being able to sleep at night, not having any food in the house except when I would buy it, I snapped.
I started to plan her faked suicide.
I was going to feed her every pill in her pill box (literally a 10 gallon tupperware filled with pill bottles).
The reason I didn't try is actually because other people tried to kill her before and it didn't work.
Also, I wasn't really sure how I was going to get her to take all those pills without showing evidence of a struggle.
Eventually, I broke down and told my best friend what was going on.
She immediately told her parents and I went to live with her until I went to college.

178	"During my time at nautical college a big group of us went out on the town to get shit faced.
We'd had a really rough time with exams and that's what we wanted to do.
As the night goes on the flock of guys collides with a flock of girls from the same college and we all start to hang out together as one of the girls has been having a real hard time at home so we all thought that having a massive group of people, going to all the same places, for this girl we didn't know just to cheer her up would be an awesome idea.
Towards the end of the night our collective flock has gone down to just a few and one of the best guys I'd ever met was really getting into one of the girls as they're tucked away quietly into a corner.
Thinking nothing of this I decide to leave the two love birds alone and make way for my own conquest.
As we're all leaving that last club, my friends girl starts to freak out in the middle of the street, nearly getting hit by a car and then falling flat on her face.
We're all wondering WTF and decide to make sure she's ok and ask her what's wrong.
She then starts crying and screaming that my friend had given her drugs, oh boy.
I'd only known this guy for a year but we'd spent practically everyday chilling out together and never once seen him do drugs of any nature.
In the merchant navy if you get caught with drugs in your system you're pretty much blacklisted for employment on a global scale so not many people risk it.
I tell my friend to just go back to the flat and I'd help out the girl that was freaking out, make sure she was ok as her friends were going nuts at the whole thing and started panicking.
Eventually an ambulance turns up and they take her away to hospital, one of the girls asks me to go to the hospital in a taxi while she went with the 'victim' in the ambulance.
At the hospital the victim girl is describing what happened in ever growing detail and all this just makes me sick to my stomach, the way she was telling things, the guy i was hanging out with all that time had been a date raper or something.
The girls mother is at the hospital when all this is coming out and decides to pursue this with the full extent of the law, the police get involved.
This next bit is from what the victims mother told me.
The next day the police decide to check out the security tapes at the nightclub to see what they can see.
It turns out the VICTIM girl was the one that pulled out the drugs and from the looks of the video tried to slip my friend a couple of ""somethings"" into to his drink!
BUT he caught her trying to do this and went off at her and he ended up getting the fuck away from there.
Now she's on her own and decides to pop the pills for herself.
A few minutes is when we would have all been outside.
It was the last time for a long time we did any favors for randoms!

179	"This one is probably going to get buried but here goes.
Several years ago, I had a very easy job doing IT for a school and me and the district managers were very good friends.
Well, a friend of mine was posting on myspace at the time (I know, so long ago, right?
) about being total destitute and living at his parents place while being around 24 at the time.
So, I talk to my boss and there happen to be an opening at another school that we did work for.
I had him send in his resume to my boss and he got the job.
He lived out of town when he was offered a job (5 hours from where I live) and he had no place to stay and no money to get a place.
So I offer to do several things.
1) Help him move
2) Stay with us rent free for like 2 months while he got on his feet
3) Only made him pay 1/3 of the rent and utilities.
So I fly down to his hometown, help load up the uhaul and drive back to my city and to my place.
We sign a new lease with a new townhouse (he didnt sign it, stupid stupid me) and we moved in.
From that point on, he refused to help with ANYTHING at the house stating ""I didn't make the mess so I am not going to help.
"" No dishes, no vacumming nothing.
No help at all with anything.
Then he started getting very reclusive only staying in his room and never opening the door and would drive 5 hours every weekend to his hometown to be with his pyscho fucking girlfriend.
Well shit hit the fan with my new job I got that was a huge increase in pay and I got let go and couldnt go back to my old job with my old awesome boss.
So, instead of trying to return the favor of me helping him out, he decides to just up and move out to a new apartment on the other side of the city.
A month or two later just quits his job at the place I got him work with nearly no notice and just bailed on us all.
Fuck if I will ever help anyone again.
That was the last straw.
(though we (my wife and I) fell victim to niceness several times after that and got horribly burned each time.
I fucking hate people.

181	"My story will be buried and blah blah blah, but doesn't matter, it's good to get it off my chest.
So I am around 11 years old, playing with my friends in the playground outside, when I saw that my mate Chris had fallen over, It was no big deal, he suffered badly from Spina Bifida, and part of that seems to be that his legs would just suddenly give way, as if someone had just turned his legs switch to ""Off"".
I, being the biggest 11 year old you've ever seen in your life, just below 5 foot and around 130 lbs, went over to help him up, like I always did dozens of other times.
Cue this new cunt of a playground monitor, she was around 45, 350 lbs and could only manage to wear velcro shoes because she couldn't bend over long enough to tie laces.
She Screams ""GET OFF HIM NOW ROBERT!
"" and in a sudden panic I dropped him after getting him halfway up.
He starts to cry because he wasn't expecting to be dropped, especially by me, it was obviously a shock to him too.
I too start to cry and I shout back at her ""WHY DID YOU SHOUT AT ME?"".
It was at this time that the Head Master came out, told me to ""GO TO MY OFFICE NOW"" and so I went, crying, while Tweedle-dum and Tweedle-dee dicked around, getting out this specialist equipment meant to lift him, in EXACTLY the same way as I did, like an under the arms mechanical hoist.
He kept crying for the entire 10 minutes he had to stay sat awkwardly on a paving slab until they lifted him, but not because he was in pain, but because nobody talked to him to calm him down.
My parents get called, we all sit down in the Head Masters office while I get called a bully, a disruptive influence, a lyer, disrespectful of teachers, and my parents get a twisted worse case scenario that if someone lifts him he could die or some such shit.
I get sent home for the week to think about what I did.
My parents thankfully believed my side of the story when I explained it to them at home, but they sided with the Head Master while we were there because  ""we didn't want to argue with him"".
Chris kept falling, but no one dared go near him again when it happened, they just called for the teacher to bring the massive hoist again, like the dumb kid who has to wear the Dunce hat, at least 3 times every break-time.
I never really talked to Chris after that, smiled at him once in a while, and he smiled back, but never chatted ever again, I learned a year ago that he died not long after he left school from his other complications.
The other kids thought I was a monster because the school monitor discreetly told some kids ""If you see Rob ever pushing anyone around again, like he pushed Chris, you run and tell me"".
Spent the next 7 years as a bit of an outcast because the story would get more twisted to the point where I was meant to have beaten Chris up.
Pretty much changed my life from one thing to another, I hate myself for my selfishness, but I wish I never helped Chris, I fucking hate myself for thinking it but I do, I lost all my other friends, no one came round to the house anymore, no one came to my 13th birthday even though I invited 20 other kids, got laughed at after the weekend it happened, got asked by everyone who was supposed to come If I had had a nice Birthday.
I just didn't bother with birthdays after that.
For my 18th I just had a chocolate cake with my parents and sister, then went out and caught a bus to the cinema, watched Spider-man on my own.

185	"Similar story.
My mom found a phone in the middle of a car park near an Ikea.
It was low on battery (it was dead by the point she brought it home), so she picked it up and brought it home because she doesn't speak English that well.
She gets it home, we plug it in to charge and try to find a contact that would allow us to find the owner and return it to him.
Before we're able to go to find a contact that is similar to ""Mom"", ""Dad"" or something similar, it starts ringing.
I answer and the person on the other end says... something.
I couldn't understand him at all.
If you've played GTAIV, he sounded exactly like the guy that crashed with Little Jacob.
I tried to explain to him that we found the phone near an Ikea, but he just started sounding more and more angry.
He just hung up, leaving me confused.
Then the phone rang again.
This time, it was a woman's voice.
She said she was the owner's sister.
I explained the situation to her, while she was trying to accuse me of stealing it.
It was late at night so arranging a pickup wasn't really possible.
We finally got to an agreement that we'll arrange the pickup for the next day.
The next morning comes (it's a Saturday) and the phone's ringing again, even though it's really early.
I pick up and tell her the area we live in so she can pick it up.
She says she'll be on her way.
She then calls multiple times asking me to come somewhere closer to where she currently is, which is inconvenient as fuck for me, as I wasn't able to drive or get around town without paying for bus/train tickets, so I tell her I can't do that.
This is repeated a few times, with her sounding slightly angrier each time.
She finally gets to the place we've first arranged, it's 3pm.
She gets out of the car, grabs the phone, barks an angry ""thanks"" and gets back in the car and drives off.
It wasn't as much of being punished for my help, but the stress, inconvenience and the amount of time that I had to spend to help someone get their phone back.
I mean, I could have just thrown the SIM card out and sold it off (it was a shitty Nokia phone, but still), so the least she could do was to not be angry at me, especially when I just tried to help.

I live in Southern Ontario, and sometimes we get some farkin cold weather.
One night I was leaving my mums house from a visit, and it was ""colder than a witches tit"" as my dad would say ... somewhere around -30, plus some wind.
It was fucking cold.
So I'm driving back to my place when I see a girl, late teens early 20s, walking down the road in an un-sensible outfit... knee length skirt, runners, sweatshirt, no hat, gloves, coat.
On a whim I pulled up beside her and said ""its fucking cold, can I give you a ride somewhere .. you shouldn't be out walking in this weather"".
she smiled and said sure, hops in my car and I start moving.
Idle conversation starts ... where are you from, what do you do, where are you going.
Then she asks ""do you like to party?
"" ..
I was like ""I've been to a party or two I suppose"".
she said ""no, i mean, do you like to go out and pickup girls and party?
"" .. me, still stupid ""well, I go to parties, but the picking up isn't really a strong point *laugh*"".
She says ""well, you can always pick up with me"" and proceeds to reach her hand over and put it on my thigh, then she says ""for $100 I can keep going"".
I laughed and brushed her hand aside by claiming I had to shift, and said thanks but no.
She asked if I was shy, or if I thought she didn't mean it ..
I told her maybe shy, but not interested.
Then she upped the ante ... ""for $200 I'll dress up like a schoolgirl and you can fuck me in the ass""

After a quick gulp, I asked her how much further until we got where she needed to go.
It was just ahead so I pulled in .. she climbed out of the car and said ""last chance"", turned around, lifted up her skirt and showed me her bare ass.
I told her to have a good night and she sighed and said ok, and closed the door.
I immediately called my mother and, laughing hard, said "" I just accidently picked up a hooker!"".
For years now she's been telling people that only I could try and offer someone a ride on the coldest night of the year and end up with a hooker.
And yes, I'm sure some of you would have taken her up on the offer, but that's just not my thing :)

I get them, and there is SO MUCH bullshit on there that I did NOT do, such as a dent on her bumper, the door on the other side of the car being messed up, and even her mirrors being chipped.
I was livid.
I asked her to get an actual estimate with just the dent and she tried to make up some bullshit about how they needed to remove her back bumper to fix her front passenger door.
I told her how I didn't appreciate being lied to and how she tried to scam me, so I just ignored all calls from that point on.

206	"I found a dog (pit bull) wandering in my neighborhood along a busy street.
I hopped out of my car and put my dog's spare collar on him to keep him from being hit.
I walked to all the nearby houses and knocked on the doors asking if anybody belongs to the dog or if they knew who did.
After about 10 houses I gave up and took him home.
That afternoon I made ""found dog"" fliers (without the dog's picture), about 100 in all and put the up around the area.
In front of my house I put a big one so people would know that this was the place.
After a few days I had pretty much resigned myself to keeping the guy when I got a phone call.
The lady gave a perfect description of the dog and I told her she could swing by and pick him up.
About an hour later she shows up, with the cops.
She gets out of her car and greets me with 
""Are you the asshole that stole my dog?!?
""
I was of course taken aback.
I stood there with a slack jaw not knowing what to say.
""I asked you a question!
Did you steal my dog?!
""
""What?
NO!
I found a dog and tried to find his home!
""
""You stole him and I have witnesses!
"" she then tried to get the officer to arrest me.
It only took a few moments for the officer to realize she was crazy.
""So he stole your dog, asked all your neighbors who the dog belonged to, put up signs saying he had the dog and then invited you over to take the dog back?
Either he's the worst criminal in the world or you don't understand the definition of 'stole' ma'm.
""
She then claimed I stole the dog for the reward money.
The officer said he didn't see an offer for a reward nor did I ask for one.
""But just out of curiosity, how much reward money were you going to offer?
"" asked the officer
""$200!
That's what he wants, that's why he took the dog!
""
""Well, we have no evidence of him stealing the dog but it seems to me that he's earned the reward money.
""
Worst $200 I ever earned.

218	"One summer I was walking my dalmatian (Sweet Pea) and there was this Chihuahua loose and it ended up running into my grandmother (who was visiting for the summer).
Anyways, we spent an entire Saturday afternoon looking for the owners going door to door and someone offered to hand the dog over to a friend who raises Chihuahuas which was good enough for us.
A few days later I see a poster for the lost dog and rush over to the people we gave the dog to in the process of handing the Chihuahua to their friend.
A few weeks later I see the Chihuahua running loose but with another dog.
I couldn't catch them, but I saw her (Chihuahua -we call her Pee Pee) again a month later with a golden retriever and they ended up in our backyard.
The dogs have tags with their owner's information so we call and the family says they'll be right over.
This family lives down the street from us and they pick up the dog and give us a bottle of wine as a thank you.
After a few months we find the Pee Pee, the golden retriever, and this third dog I saw with her the first time one school morning.
So we call the owners at 7:15 AM to let them know their dogs are loose again and in our property to which the oldest daughter starts crying and begging me to ""please why do you steal our dogs?
Please stop stealing our dogs!

Was driving home middle of winter at night on a busy street.
This lady is stopped in the left lane im coming up behind her and thinking she is turning but didnt turn on her blinkers i go around her.
As im going by her looking infront of me i see this white thing in the road that i think is just snow.
as im going over it, it turns and looks at me and its a fucking little dog all white.
i go over it.
i immediantly pull into the nearest driveway which isnt to close but still visable from the lady in the car.
i walk over to check on the dog which is visibly shaken but not injured short of a small bleeding scratch on its head probably from a hangar that was holding my muffler on.
Me and this guy who i dont know are trying to keep the dog warm and safe from more traffic but its trying to bite us so we aint trying to pick it up.
The owner shows up after a few minutes and the lady who was stopped in the left lane comes out of her car.
Guy asks what happened boyfriend tells him then the lady says and the guy who hit him didnt even stop just drove off and shes all freaking out and shit.
Soon as she said it im like i was the one who hit him.
I look at the owner and apologize then give the owner a blanket from my car to put the dog in to get it off the street and warm it up and my business card and offer him a ride home.
The lady the whole time just talking shit about me for hitting a dog she basically made me hit by stopping on a busy road and making me go around her she didnt have caution lights on or anything so i thought for sure she was just some ahole who didnt put their blinker on to turn.
The owner was cool about it all though and thanked me for stopping and trying to keep the dog warm and from further injury.
Ladys boyfriend was also cool and thought it was somewhat sad situation nothing bad really happened dog was alright just scared shitless as i bet i would have been if i was him also lol.
Owner asked us to keep a lookout for his other dog said he had two and both got out both were white and small.
Never found the other one though i went to look just hoping i could save the other from getting hurt or worse.

221	"I was 16 and getting on the last bus of the night to go home.
It was about 10:30.
A man got on the bus a couple stops after I had.
He was 25 cents short and the bus driver was trying to tell him that he couldn't get on without it, but he didn't speak any English.
I casually got out of my seat, and put a quarter into fare box for him.
It really wasn't a big deal.
My house was sort of in the boonies.
No street lights and the houses were pretty spread out, but it was only a quarter mile from my house to the bus stop.
I get off on my stop and notice that this man had gotten off with me.
I immediately knew something was wrong because no one else ever gets off the bus out there.
I had time to lay one solid pound on the side of the bus while it was pulling away to try to stop the driver, but it didn't work.
I didn't make eye contact.
I walked as quickly as I could, and so did he.
Then he started running.
I wasn't sure if I would make it to my house and didn't know if I wanted him knowing where I lived even if I could.
I ran to the one house in between mine and the bus stop.
It was a fucking humongous house.
I had never met the people that lived there, but I didn't care.
As I was about halfway up the driveway I couldn't hear him behind me anymore.
Two giant people answered the door.
I was shaking, and looking down the driveway, and trying to explain what happened.
I just wanted to use the phone to call my folks.
Then I realize that I'm speaking to two giant teenagers, they tell me to wait and they would get their dad.
Turns out dad was a bald, 7ft, 350lb badass who fucking hates immigrants.
I asked if I could use the phone and he said he would just drive me home.
We go get in his gigantic pickup truck.
I told him which way I lived, and which way I thought the guy went.
Giant redneck dad decides to find this dude first.
He pulled up behind him, turned his brights on, and screamed profanities while acting like he was going to run him over.
Neighbor took me home.
I never called the cops.
I started carrying a knife.

She said she'd pay for everything, she just needed a date.
So I agreed.
The next day people begin to start calling me ""Scandal of the Year"".
Apparently after I agreed to go with her she called her ex and told him I asked her to the dance.
She knew he would get jealous and come back for his lady.
Somehow she also convinced him I was the reason they split in the first place.
He sent a forward out to the entire senior class calling me the scandal of the year, and saying that he was gonna kick my ass.
He was THE state champion wrestler.
The thing that pissed me off the most though was that I loaned her the money for the tickets, the tickets that her and her bf used to go to the dance together.
He called and said that if I ever ask her for the money back he'll put me in a coma.
And that is why I never went to Formal my senior year.

229	"A few years ago I worked for an apartment rental agency in a customer service role.
One day a girl called to ask if I could email her pictures of one of our apartments because she was currently in a different city.
I told her that this was a non-standard request so it might take a few days, and that our policy was to not rent an apartment to a tenant who hadn't seen it in person.
Two days later I was able to get one of the leasing agents to take the pictures she requested (we had to get the current tenant's permission first) and I emailed them to her, reminding her she would need to visit before signing the lease.
She called the office a few minutes later asking to speak with me.
Her response was that I'd promised I would send her pictures that same day, also that I'd promised her she could lease the apartment over the phone, and that I was now discriminating against her by preventing her from renting that apartment.
Oh, and also she was going to take me to court for discrimination.
She then asked to speak to my manager and shortly thereafter *faxed* over a written complaint about me and how horribly she had been misled and abused by me.
I ended up on probation at work because of this girl who I went out of my way to help.
Fortunately she never tried to follow up after that because honestly I have no idea what her game was.

234	"One thing that still gets me angry untill this very day.
A few years ago, a friend of my wife got into some trouble.
She had moved away with her boyfriend and got homesick, didnt know how to handle her relationship and cheated on her boyfriend with a real dickhead.
She kinda got kicked out to straighten up her act, but her boyfriend stood by her (unbelievable, but true), telling her to come back when she worked things out.
She had no job, no home and her parents wouldn't take her in.
Now this is especially important.
We had two little kids at the time, one was still a baby, but my wife felt sorry for her and we took her in.
We have a big house and she got a floor to herself.
Now she didn't pay rent, didn't pay for food and we helped her get therapy and get her life straight.
I helped her get a job, she got back with her boyfriend (who stayed at our house while he was in town in the weekends).
It took about 10 months and she got back with her boyfriend, all was well.
Fast forward a few years, my wife is pregnant with our third child and we just heard that he was handicapped, we just didn't know what it was yet.
Meanwhile the friend had called us, but since we were at the hospital all the time, we hadn't returned her calls.
Having a big family, we had to explain a lot of things to a lot of people and we were fucking tired.
Then we got an e-mail from her, saying she felt we were being distant and she was disappointed with us.
So, we answered in short that we were sorry to disappoint her, but we had been very busy.
We'd make it up.
Next thing you know, we get all kinds of e-mail accusing us of being rotten friends and now that she was having a family of her own, she didn't have time in her life for people that weren't there for her.
My wife wrote an e-mail back, explaining everything and even pointing out that we had put our lives on hold for her, even though we had kids of our own and we had finacially supported her for almost a year while she was depressed and unemployed, left alone by her own parents.
She let me read it, but I told her to change it into:

Dear (..),

We wish you the best, have a nice life.
Sincerely,

We decided that this was more than enough for her.

I had a pretty awesome hiding spot, so I could've stayed where I was.
My friend got attacked by a group of 8 black men in their early 20s.
I ran at them, yelling to hopefully get rid of them, and told them that I had already called the cops (I hadn't).
A couple of them stood further back, but a small group of them got in my face and wanted $20 from me (I was broke).
After it started looking worse for me, I try explaining that I was broke.
So I took out my wallet and let them look.
And while one of them is looking into the wallet that I had opened, showing them, one of the men punched me in the face.
My jaw was pretty messed up for a month or so (Swollen, couldnt eat without terrible pain.
This happened two years ago too and my jaw still makes an obnoxious popping noise when I eat.
) The other friend of mine took off his shirt and started freaking out on them.
They all took off in a van after that without getting anything out of me or my two friends.
Afterwards me and my shirtless friend were still processing what had happened because it happened so fast.
As we were calming down, we noticed that my friend's car was gone.
The friend that was first attacked that I came out of hiding for.
Not only did he leave us while we stepped in to help him, he went to Taco Bell to get a drink of water.
We could've been killed for all he knew and he didn't go for help?
And this sounds stupid, but I only filed a police report to help kids younger than me.
Im also in my early 20's and there aren't any lights over the park.
So I never expected to find the people that mugged me because it was dark and very hard to identify the people there.
My local paper published a short story of what happened on their website, and all of the comments on it were accusing me and my friends (we're white) of making this story up to start a town-wide racial battle, or make it something bigger than it was.
Others said with confidence that it was a drug deal gone bad.
The whole thing was a headache but the people reading and posting on the story probably have kids, and they don't understand that my only motive was trying to protect their kids from people I thought we would never catch.

She threw parties every night and never cleaned up.
In fact, the ONE time she did clean, she bitched for months about how messy I was.
Classy.
This was my schedule; wake up, clean house, go to school, clean house again, study, clean house before i went to bed.
They partied all day every day, and guess what!
We got evicted for noise complaint.
That never goes away, ever.
I tried to make her stop being loud but she always had like four guys over that were more than willing to kick my ass.
Also when i tried to have a descent grown-ass-people conversation with her about the messiness, late rent, and general craziness of the situation, she slapped me in the face AND BROKE MY VERSACE GLASSES.

252	"Worst date I ever had, was actually like, my first date ever.
It was super awkward asking her out, but I told her, I'd never asked a girl out before.
We made the plans together and we were meeting up for lunch at a burger place.
I pay for the meal, we sit down and I begin to eat my food.
She barely eats anything, telling me she ate before hand.
You know....because when you're meeting someone for lunch you don't want to sit there eating with them.
She then talks about her job at starbucks, and how she spits in drinks and gives rude people who ask for decaf regular caffeinated coffee.
Other gross things like, picking her nose and putting it in the food and just, blech.
I was not laughing or in anyway acting interested in this topic.
She also decides to remind me, we will not be having sex.
This is my first date with a girl ever.
I told her this, she knows this.
Yet, she felt the need to say this.
As if some how I was giving her the signals that I needed to do her right then and there at this burger place?
She checks her phone multiple times, texts people and seems to be having a more interesting conversation with someone else.
She goes on about how ugly and fat she is.
Which she wasn't, I know some women do tend to have self-esteem issues.
I now know though, she did this in excess for a date.
I tried to tell her different, but I think she honestly lost respect me for me because I found her attractive.
She talks about how badly she wants to date some celebrity, idk who, we'll say Michael Cera for the hell of it.
How cute is, how she wants to marry him.
I'm just basically feeling like, I'm not in anyway talking to a real person.
Like, this seemed like the plot of a Kate Hudson movie or something.
I was pretty well convinced this was not going to work.
So, the date ends, and it actually was pretty short.
I think it was only an hour or so, but it felt like so much longer.
After that, she was still texting me and trying to go out with me, but I just couldn't.
This date only feels worse and worse each time I think of it.
As being my first date, I didn't think how bad it was till I went on more.
Then I realized what a horrible date she was being.

[Original Link.
](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/s6ngh/why_dating_sites_should_have_a_user_reviews/)

This happened some years ago, but it's still the best story I have in my ""Personal WTF Moments"" arsenal.
I've been with my seemingly sane GF for 3 years this May, so we're talking 5 or 6 years ago now.
I was just 21 and a bit lonely, having been single most of my life.
I broke down and started using a dating website (okcupid).
I had heard stories about 'crazy' on these sites, but I figured I'd take my chances.
After weeks of messaging with no responses I finally snag a bite.
There were some small 'red flags' on her profile; most notably the heavily angled pictures of herself and her way-to-obvious excitement.
But those things with nothing else didn't tip me off to the crazy I was in store for.
We messaged each other for a few days, then IMed for a few more days and then started talking on the phone.
Phone conversations went for a good week.
The impression I got from her was excitable, friendly and a little quarky, but nothing in our conversations foreshadowed batshit nuts.
On one Friday night, I had just got home from work and she insisted that we hang out that night; finally meeting face to face.
I said sure and offered to share my last joint (wasn't going to re-up for a while).
I agreed to pick her up and we'd hang out at my house and I'd take her home later in the evening.
I started the solid 30 minute drive to her house as she lived clear on the other side of town.
Not 5 minutes in to the trip, she calls me.
The conversation went something like this:

Her: Hey!
Could I get your number to give to my mom?
Me: (confused as she just called me, but ok) Sure 4-1-2-5-5-5..
Her: Wait!
4-1 what?
(she lives in the same area with the same area code) Me: 4.... 1.... 2........... 5.... 5....
Her: 4-1-3-6-7 what?!
How about you just come in and meet my mother?
Just so she knows who I'm with.
I figured sure, why not.
I'm good with parents typically and it's only fair to her mother.
I was a little confused about the conversation we had just had, her seemingly incapable of copying a simple phone number.
But meh, I'm already on the way there.
I finally get to the house, and she's waiting for me outside.
The first thing I notice: her pictures were bold lies!
But I'm not that shallow of a dude, so whatever.
I can deal with that.
She wasn't bad, but nothing like her pictures.
But then, when I pull up and get out of my car, she runs up to me and plants the sloppyist kiss on me I have ever in my life received.
She's bear hugging me like we're long lost friends and screeching like mad.
We head in to the house, a homey 2 story + basement obviously furnished by a grandmother... actually, her 70 year old mother who I meet in a dining room converted in to a second living room.
her daughter is going nuts, she's going on and on about what a great guy I am and how nice I am and what fun we're going to have and on and on and on.
Her mother is just sitting there knitting, smiling and nodding asking small questions like how old I am, where I grew up, etc.
After a few minutes, the daughter notices the tattoo I have on my right calf; it's a set of thorns busting out of my knee cap in the standard black ink.
This girl literally drops onto the floor, and forcefully takes my leg and presses it into her lap.
She then begins to caress my calf and ramble on about all the awesome ideas she has for expanding my tattoo and how awesome they're going to be, like we had agreed to something never discussed.
I'm taking this all in stride, figuring she's just as lonely as I had been and getting a little excited.
She gets up off the floor and tells me she'll be right back with her things.
I talk with her mother for a minute or so, and she comes bowling down the stairs with a duffle bag, some clothing and toiletries, handing me her hair brush, tooth brush, shampoo and some other items I fail to remember to hold on to while she packs her bag.
It's at this moment I realize I made a big mistake, but I'm an overly patient guy (I have anger problems, so I've learned to not let most shit bother me too much).
I'm not yet to a point to call it off, but I'm beginning to really want to.
It wasn't the first batch of clothing that got me there, but when she brought what looked like a weeks worth of clothing down in a second trip.
An overnight bag says ""we're getting laid""; a weeks worth of clothing and toiletries?
RED FLAG.
But we're not done yet.
After the second batch of clothing, she insists that I come up and help her grab a few more things out of her room.
I oblige, being the nice guy that I am.
I follow her up the stairs, trailing further and further behind as she's practically running.
I approach the top of the stars, and have to do a U-turn around a wall to enter her room.
I turn the corner and holy shit.... SHE JUST DROPPED TROW!
She's standing there, pants around her ankles, motioning to me with a come-hither finger and a half-cracked smile.
Now, the fact that what was underneath was in itself a turn off wasn't my issue, it was her 70 year old mother down the fucking stairs!
So I tell ask her to ""please put your pants back on.
"" She responds, ""What, you don't like what you see?
"" I reply ""it's not what I see, it's your mother downstairs.
please put your pants back on.
"" And then a fucking bombshell, ""Fine, just come in and shut the door so you don't wake my kid.
"" !!!!!!
SHE HAS A FUCKING KID!
That woulda been something to mention.
I'm not against dating chicks with kids, but a heads up would be nice, especially when you're an 18 year old mother going out on a date with a 20 year old with no kids, and hardly a future at the time.
I walk in, shut the door, and she drops to the floor again and starts acting like she can't figure out how to put her pants on.
She going on, ""Gaaawwwwd, this is soooo haaaarrdddd.
Where are the holes on these things?
"" On and on like she's hasn't done this every day of her fucking life.
It's at this point that I've had enough.
""Hey.
Maybe tonight's a bad night.
I have to be up early tomorrow.
I'll call you in the afternoon.
Cool?
""

And then, something I didn't expect.
She starts begging.
She is on her knees now, still pantless, grabs my hand and begs, ""Please please please?!
Take me with you!
just for a couple of days!
We can do anything you want!
We can have sex!
You can tie me up!
PLEASE just take me with you for a few days!
""

A FEW FUCKING DAYS!
This was supposed to be a single evening event, maybe a one night thing.
But days?!
Fuck... NO!
I insist, ""No, really.
I wasn't looking for sex.
I'll call you tomorrow, I promise.
It's just a bad night.
"" It's a terrible excuse, but at this point I don't give a fuck, I'm just trying to leave.
She continues to beg, and I continue to insist; on for a few minutes and then...
I watch as her face goes from vulnerable and desperate to giving me a ""look"" like I have never seen.
She's now scowling at me like I just morphed in to lady-bashing demon-man.
The following statement, which she whispers like the incarnate of Satan, she turns up the crazy to 11 and solidifies our non-future, ""You're just like the rest of them!
A nothing!
A no one!
You're a piece of SHIT and will NEVER amount to ANYTHING!!
""

Bam.
That's that.
With that, I drop her hand, and walk the fuck out with not a single look back.
I'm out the door in seconds, in my car and gone.
But is the crazy done?
No.
After driving home and sharing this insane story with my mother (who thought it was fucking HILARIOUS, btw) I remove her from my myspace friends, block her on okcupid and AIM and erase her number from my phone.
I'm done with this girl, no reason to make it easy for her to get in contact with me again, which I didn't even expect.
The next day, I get this text from her, ""WTF?
I have one drunk night and you BLOCK ME?!
Why are you being an asshole?!
"" I didn't respond, as I'm not going to go down any road with crazy, but seriously?
that's the excuse?
Alcohol?
That kind of crazy transcends to sobriety, I have no want in this.
I only get one more text from her, ""FINE!
Be an asshole.
I didn't want to be with you anyways.
I can't believe ONE NIGHT of being drunk and you're willing to end this!
FUCK YOU!
""

And that was that.
I tell this story to fucking everyone and figured you guys might enjoy it.
So yeah, that's why I stopped using dating sites and found my SO in a face to face, friends first fashion.

261	"So I met this guy at a party for a friend of a friend.
I'm pretty shy so I ended up kind of hanging out in a corner by myself and met a guy who was also a friend of a friend of the host.
He was pretty cute and funny so we spent most of the night talking and the subsequent few days texting and calling each other on and off.
Finally, he invited me out on a date to go horse back riding.
Cool, I love horses.
I'm down.
We live in a bigger city so we have to drive for about 1.5 hour to get to the place where he boards his horses.
On the way there we chat and generally bullshit until we're about 15 minutes away, then he gets really quiet.
I take this as him getting tired of driving and just enjoy the music and scenery.
We get to the place and he literally hops out of the truck before he even puts it in park and RUNS towards the stable calling his horse's name.
I put the car in park thinking that it's been forever since he's seen her and he really loves his horse.
I follow him to where he goes and he's in the stable feeding her carrots and lovingly stroking her nose.
He gives me a carrot and shows me how hold my hand to feed her and instructs me to give her a carrot.
The horse eyeballs me, turns her head and walks away.
Whatever.
Whorse.
He loans me a horse to ride and we go on a mini ride and picnic.
Any time he got close enough to touch me or hold my hand his horse would ""mysteriously"" veer away from me.
After we're done we pile into the truck and make the drive home.
About a mile and a half from my exit, he asked me what I thought of his horse.
I said she was cool and I thought she was beautiful.
Then he dropped a bomb on me.
He said he was having sex with his horse.
And that they were ""in love"".
The only reason he was dating was because he knew he was going to die before her.
He told me that if we were to date that I was not to make him choose because he would ALWAYS choose her first and that she was his priority.
In other words, I would be second fiddle to a horse.
I've had some pretty awful dates, but if I ever top that one I'm joining a convent.

267	"Do zilla-esque wedding planners count?
My mother-in-law was heavily involved in planning our wedding, for which I was very grateful.
She has tons of contacts in the local small business community due to being a small business owner herself, and loves planning/hosting events.
I can't begin to describe everything she did for our wedding day.
However, one of her less-than-stellar decisions was to hire (without previously consulting me) a day-of coordinator- basically someone whose job it is to supervise and coordinate all the vendors and events on the wedding day.
At first I was just mildly irritated to not have met this woman before a contract was signed, but I didn't care very much because it was a role that needed to be filled.
Then I actually met her.
She rubbed me wrong from the start.
For one thing, she kept confusing my mother-in-law with my actual mother, though both ladies were present and she was corrected multiple times.
Then she told me straight-up that I was being criminally inconsiderate of my guests by hosting an outdoor wedding- which was out of line regardless, but this was six weeks before the wedding and some shit just can't be changed, so why bring it up?
She criticized our food, my bridesmaids (what do you mean you're only having two and they won't match?!
), our music selections, and our choice of opting out of certain traditions like a garter toss.
She talked herself up plenty though- how many lovely brides who were absolutely dependent on her, how she was the best in the business, etc.
It was quite clear that she would have preferred to plan the whole damn thing herself and resented me for not allowing it.
It was also quite clear that she held cookie-cutter wedding tradition on par with a religious experience and found me and my wedding plans to be heretical, and it was her duty to instruct me on the error of my ways.
I'm not going to lie, after that meeting I would have fired her myself if my MIL hadn't already signed the contract.
I didn't want her to be on the hook for any deposit, so I grit my teeth and figured all she had to do was show up on time and tell people where to go.
She never showed up to the rehearsal at all, which was in her contract.
She was late to the wedding (our best man's wonderful wife stepped up and filled in).
At the reception, she was again late, which meant my husband and I missed most of the beginning due to being penned up inside the house waiting for someone to figure out what was going on.
She then proceeded to screw up every single part of her job.
She brought me a plate of food before the caterer was done setting up, and indeed before I was ready for it, which meant I had to go back and get the rest of the food (not like I needed a plate brought to me, anyway).
I had to give the bartenders their instructions because she neglected to do so.
She never told the DJ when to cut out our first dance song so it went on about three minutes longer than intended, into awkward territory.
She also told the DJ to queue up a bouquet toss when I explicitly told her it was not desired, leading to maybe the most embarrassing moment of the day for all involved, as none of my friends or relatives wanted to participate either.
Things she was supposed to set out, like our guest signing area, were set up by my mother and aunt after we arrived.
We had sparklers to light at the end of the evening that never got put out at all.
She couldn't even get the fucking cake right- and ARGUED with me when I politely asked the caterer to unbox the top, as that was the flavor I wanted to eat and it was made clear to her from our initial meeting that we had no plans to save the top.
I did, however, see her thoroughly enjoying our food and beverages as though she were a guest later in the evening.
The real kicker for me, though, is after telling me that my wedding decorations were cheap garbage, she tried to steal my paper lanterns the following day while she was watching my loving family disassmeble the reception site.

270	"I feel sorry for the people who marry bridezillas, and those who even have to be around and deal with them.
I am getting married in a month and my fiance is the furthest thing from a bridezilla, which I am very happy about.
Her mom and grandma are worse to deal with than her.
We both have been super laid back about the whole planning process.
Honestly I dont get what all the hype about weddings are.
You are getting married, isnt that the idea...not showing off.
If something goes wrong, so be it, its life, nobody is perfect.

271	"I attended the wedding of a family friend's daughter, so didn't really know her.
It was a nighttime reception, so probably from 6pm-11 or 12, the ceremony immediately preceding.
When we went into the reception, we were expecting a buffet or something to be set up, but there was nothing.
Later we found out that there was no food for the 120 guests, but rather a cheese spread, fruit platter, and vegetables with dip.
After an hour, people were really hungry and some people started to leave because they were expecting to be fed and didn't want to stay.
When the bride found out, she ran across the room in her dress and blocked the doors, screaming about how everyone is ruining her wedding and screaming ""Bride's Day, Bride's Way!
"" It was such a scene that her father had to peel her off the door (don't know where the husband was, probably cowering) and people who didn't know her that well all left.
I heard through the grapevine that she was inconsolable the entire night, got trashed and threw up (hopefully on her dress, but not sure).
Oh well, Bride's Day, Bride's Way!
