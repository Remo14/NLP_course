Nicholas Levene , 48 , was jailed for 13 years last November after he admitted orchestrating a lucrative Ponzi scheme which raked in # 316million .

The Serious Fraud Office found that Levene had conned # 32,352,027 from some of Britain 's most successful businessmen .  But with interest and lost profits , his clients are believed to be # 101,685,406 out of pocket .  It is unclear how much , if any of this , his victims have recouped . Justine Davidge , representing the SFO , told Southwark Crown Court yesterday that Levene had been subject to a bankruptcy order since October 2009 and there were ongoing investigations into his assets .  Jailed : Levene , nicknamed Beano because of his love of the comic  pictured left on the trading floor in 1990 , and right with wife Tracy  , was jailed for 13 years in November last year  She added that anything seized would be dealt with by bankruptcy officials .  ` In respect of the realisable amount , we suggest the court make a nominal order of # 1 to be paid in seven days , ' she said . ` It may be in the future , Mr Levene could come into further realisable assets . '  Levene admitted ripping off a series of high-fliers , including Sir Brian Souter and his sister Ann Gloag , the founders of the Stagecoach bus and rail group ; Richard Caring , owner of The Ivy and Le Caprice restaurants in the West End ; and Russell Bartlett , director of the R3 Investment Group and former owner of Hull City Football Club .

Levene , a former deputy chairman of Leyton Orient Football Club , admitted one count of false accounting , one of obtaining a money transfer by deception , and 12 of fraud .  He would take from Peter to pay Paul and move the funds between accounts in the financial havens of Jersey , Switzerland and Israel .

But he dug an ever-deepening financial hole for himself , having to fob off clients and make excuses about why he could not pay them .

His gambling was huge , with investigators finding evidence of him blowing # 720,000 on a cricket match bet in 2007 .

1	By Helen Pow  PUBLISHED :  09:16 EST , 29 May 2013   |  UPDATED :  10:51 EST , 29 May 2013  Miami Heat superstar LeBron James gave a touching tribute to one of his biggest fans last night - wearing her name on his sneakers just hours after she lost a grueling six-year battle with cancer .  Bella Rodriguez-Torres , 10 , loved nothing more than watching the Heat play basketball with her family . But she passed away yesterday after fighting the disease for more than half her young life .  Bella was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer at age four , and astounded doctors when she recovered from the illness - something her parents deemed a miracle .  But last year , her tumors returned , and , despite putting up another fierce fight , her condition deteriorated and she slipped away peacefully surrounded by family and friends .  SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO  Brave battle : Bella Rodriguez-Torres , pictured left and right , died on Tuesday after a six year battle with cancer  Family : Bella Rodriguez-Torres , pictured bottom left in happy times with her father Raymond , mother Shannah and little sister , bottom right , Rayna , was diagnosed with cancer aged four  ` Bella did n't lose her battle with cancer but instead won the reward of an eternal life , ' her mother , Shannah , told CBS4 .  Bella 's parents , Raymond and Shannah , and Bella 's younger sister , Rayna , coined the phrase ` Live Like Bella ' during her extensive and grueling chemotherapy sessions .  And at Tuesday night 's Miami Heat Vs Pacers game , LeBron James and Dwyane Wade wore shoes with #LiveLikeBella written on them in honor of the brave Heat fan .  '  Dwyane  came to me with the story today , it was a no-brainer , ' James said on Tuesday , according to Yahoo Sport . ` It 's sad . It puts everything in perspective . At the end of the day , this game is just basketball . Two great teams , we 're competing . But it 's just basketball .  ` You have a little girl , or any kid that loses her life over an illness . It 's very sad . It 's very sad ... what happened to Bella puts everything in perspective . '  Strong : The little girl loved to watch the Heat play , and copy her idol , LeBron , right ,  Heat fan : Basketball star LeBron James wore sneakers , pictured , with Bell 's name on them on Tuesday night in the little Heat fan 's honor  Shannah and Bella 's father , Raymond , broke the sad news on their daughter 's Facebook page , which has more than 62,000 followers .  Quoting the bible , they wrote : ` When he had received the drink , Jesus said , `` It is finished . '' With that , he bowed his head and gave up his spirit . '  Before adding : ` Bella has now joined Jesus in heaven . She went peacefully , surrounded by love ... '  Bella was a happy , bubbly toddler who loved Sponge Bob Square Pants and playing with Lego .  But in 2007 , at the tender age of just four , she became paralyzed from a tumor on her spine and was diagnosed with stage four Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma .  She was thrown into a life of chemotherapy - 54 weeks of it - radiation - 16 weeks - and surgery as doctors battled to rid her little body tumors in more than seven sites .  But rid they did . And soon she was in remission .  ' I am able to walk , run and jump again ! ' her parents exclaimed for her on her website at the time .  Five times over : Bella had made news for fighting cancer five times in the course of her short life  Close : Bella Rodriguez-Torres ' family , pictured with her , were by her side throughout her grueling battle  But the dogged illness returned in April 2009 , when doctors found a tumor in her brain and she underwent full brain radiation plus more chemotherapy .  She won again , however , and was in remission until September 2011 , when the cancer attacked her ovary .  The following January , three new tumors were discovered in her abdomen and she had further treatment . But just a month later , four tumors were found in her pelvis and by January 2013 , despite undergoing chemotherapy again , doctors found the tumors had grown .  The seriousness of her condition led doctors to recommend intensive surgery , and in March , Bella traveled from Miami to Houston to have a 16 hour surgery to remove the tumors , her uterus , her ovaries and to have her entire abdomen washed in hot chemo .  Though despite those treatments , Bella 's organs began failing .  Her kidney and lung functions were greatly affected and her bone marrow was exhausted plus ultrasounds of Bella 's lungs showed new disease had appeared on the lining .  Tributes : Tributes are piling in for Bella who inspired many with her courage  Hospice : Bella , pictured , had been under hospice care since the beginning of May  At the start of May , her parents made the difficult decision to stop treatment and she entered a hospice .  ` There are few words that can describe what it feels like to have to make a decision of this magnitude . While it has been painstaking to decide to no longer fight and now just ensure her comfort , we are at peace , ' her mother told CBS4 earlier this month .  Through-out her six-year battle , her parents have chronicled her progress , and the high highs and extremely low lows have been followed by thousands around the world . Many well-wishers have donated money to help pay for her care and prayed for the brave little girl and her family .  And that 's what her heartbroken parents asked for most of all on Tuesday .  ` Please pray for us now for the strength and peace to continue to #LIVELIKEBELLA , ' they said .

4	It is perceived as one of the most introverted countries in the world with a policy of eradicating any outside influence from foreign nations .  But a photographer 's stunning collection of images from his journey through the Republic of Iran offers a rare insight into what life in the Islamic state is really like .  With its tiny villages nestled into the side of mountains and picturesque farm land , which is rarely seen by outsiders , the country is as enchanting as it is mysterious .  But photographer Amos Chapple said the real surprise of Persia was not its untouched and beautiful countryside , but how different it is from ` western perceptions of the country ' .  Palangan Village , in the mountains near the Iraq border . Palangan , illustrative of many of the country 's rural settlements , has benefited handsomely from government support . Many villagers are employed in a nearby fish farm , or are paid members of the Basij , whose remit includes prevention of ` westoxification ' , and the preservation of everything the 1979 Islamic revolution and its leader the Ayatollah Khomeini stood for , including strict rules on female clothing and male/female interaction .  Two shepherds lead Palangan 's flock of communally-owned sheep out to pasture . The government 's spending in some rural regions has bought them a network of loyal followers who can be scrambled at any time to crush trouble in the urban centers . Rural Basij were used as a part of the crackdown in 2009 which resulted in the deaths of seven anti-government protestors .  A group of friends in the hills above Tehran . Many  every single one I met  young Iranians feel deeply embarrassed by their government , and the way the nation is perceived abroad . Zac Clayton , a British cyclist who will finish a round-the-world cycle on March 23 described Iran as having the kindest people of any country he cycled through . ' I found most Iranians -- particularly the younger generation -- to be very aware of the world around them ... with a burning desire for the freedoms they feel they are being denied by an out of touch , ultra-conservative religious elite . '  Chapple , from New Zealand , has visited the Islamic Republic of Iran three times between December 2011 and January 2013 to accumulate his series of photographs .  And he claims while the government continues its anti-western campaign , he found a growing discontent among the country 's youth who were embarrassed by the actions of its leaders .  He said : ' I was amazed by the difference in western perceptions of the country and what I saw on the ground .  ' I think because access for journalists is so difficult , people have a skewed image of what Iran is - the regime actually want to portray the country as a cauldron of anti-western sentiment so they syndicate news footage of chanting nutcases which is happily picked up by overseas networks .  The Mausoleum of Ayatollah Khomeini in Tehran . Work on the unfinished building has dragged over 23 years . With growing economic chaos in the country , its completion is still nowhere in sight .  At the Sa'adabad Palace complex in northern Tehran , Islamic revolutionaries sawed a statue of the deposed Shah in half . Today schoolchildren are taken on group visits past the boots and into the palace to see the decadence of the former Shah 's living quarters .  A young worker walks through the light of a stained glass window in the Tehran Bazaar . Under Khomeini Iranians were actively encouraged to produce large families . By 2009 nearly 70 per cent of all Iranians were under 30 , but according to some reports , the country is the least religious in the Middle East . Instead of the `` armies for Islam '' Khomeini had called for , the youthful population is now seen as the biggest threat to the deeply unpopular regime .  A commemorative plate of the former Shah of Iran in an antique store in Shiraz . The Shah was given an Authoritarian hold on power thanks to an MI6 and CIA-backed coup in 1953 which deposed Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh and cost the lives of several hundreds of Iranian citizens . `` Operation Ajax '' was actioned after Mosaddegh nationalized the petroleum industry of Iran , thus shutting out British dominance of an industry they had controlled since 1913 . That Mosaddeqh had been a democratically-elected leader , with wide popular support fueled resentment at the Shah , who many saw as a brutal puppet for the west . The anger at western intervention stoked strong initial support for the virulently anti-western Ayatollah Khomeini .

Pictured right is a detail of Persepolis . After the Islamic Revolution , hardline clerics called for the destruction of the site , but official unease prevailed .  Detail of Persepolis , the seat of the Ancient Persian empire . The Arab conquest of Persia led to a an Islamification of Iran but Farsi , the Iranian language , has remained alive . The 11th century poet Ferdowsi , described as ` Iran 's Homer ' , wrote an epic in Farsi which was carefully crafted with minimal Arabic influence . The ` Book of Kings ' has been credited with helping preserve the Farsi language - one of the world 's oldest . The Book of Kings ends with the Arab invasion , depicted as a disaster for Persia .  ` For ordinary Iranians though , the government is a constant embarrassment .  ` In the time I spent there I never received anything but goodwill and decency , which stands in clear contrast to my experience in other middle eastern countries . '  In one striking image , the tiny village of Palangan in the mountains near the Iraq border can be seen lit up among the hills .

Both soldiers were forced to leave the metro at the next station .  Their role is to help preserve the Islamic way of life , such as the strict rules on female clothing and the interaction of men and women , which became immersed in Iranian law in the 1979 Islamic revolution .  Wearing head coverings is mandatory for women and female police can be seen regularly checking commuters ' dress in the city . Chapple said woman are arrested if their dress is considered to be ` immodest ' .  Other images capture groups of young friends in the hills above the country 's capital Tehran who he said were frustrated with the dated regime in the country .  Chapple said : ' I found most Iranians - particularly the younger generation - to be very aware of the world around them ... with a burning desire for the freedoms they feel they are being denied by an out of touch , ultra-conservative religious elite .

6	Scientists have developed a new microscope that can image living things in 3D , ten to 100 times faster than existing technologies .  The system could be used to capture remarkable details , such as single cells in the zebrafish heart while it is beating , the researchers say .  Dubbed ` Scape ' , the technology can also help unlock the secrets of brain activity by monitoring neurons as they fire in real-time .  Scientists have developed a new microscope that can image living things in 3D , ten to 100 times faster than existing technologies . Dubbed ` Scape ' , the technology can also help unlock the secrets of brain activity by monitoring neurons as they fire in real-time  pictured   The microscope was developed by Elizabeth Hillman , associate professor of biomedical engineering at Columbia University Medical Center  CUMC  ,  ` With Scape , we can now image complex , living things , such as neurons firing in the rodent brain ... this has not been possible until now , ' said Professor Hillman .  While conventional light-sheet microscopes use two awkwardly positioned lenses , Professor Hillman realised that she could use a single lens , and then that she could sweep the light sheet to generate 3D images without moving the objective or the sample .  ` This combination makes Scape both fast and very simple to use , as well as surprisingly inexpensive , ' she said .  ` We think it will be transformative in bringing the ability to capture high-speed 3D cellular activity to a wide range of living samples . '  Imaging techniques that can capture these dizzying dynamic processes , such as neurons firing in the brain , have lagged behind other breakthroughs .  Time can be crucial when diagnosing illness . And with conditions such as cancer , the current method of testing samples of tissue for disease - a biopsy - can be a slow process , with an anxious wait for results .  The procedure can cause discomfort and pain . Furthermore , it often has to be repeated , as the sampling is not always accurate .  Now , scientists have developed the world 's smallest microscope - the size of a pin - which is inserted into the body , allowing doctors to ` see ' cancer and make an instant , precise diagnosis , saving the patient from the need for a biopsy .  It is already being used for pancreatic cancer , a disease with a poor prognosis as it 's often detected late , and scientists are now looking at using it for colon , bladder , oesophageal and lung cancer .  The endomicroscope was developed in France and is so powerful it can see individual cells and the blood vessels that run between them .  Professor Hillman has already used the system to observe firing in 3D neurons trees in layers of the mouse brain .  In small organisms , including zebrafish larvae , Scape can see through the entire organism .  By tracking these tiny , unrestrained creatures in 3D at high speeds , the microscope can capture both cellular structure and function and behaviour .  ` It was n't until we built it that we realized it was a light-sheet microscope , ' said Professor Hillman .  ` It took us a while to realize how versatile the imaging geometry was , how simple and inexpensive the layout was -- and just how many problems we had overcome . '  Next-generation versions of Scape are in development that will deliver even better speed , resolution , sensitivity , and penetration depth .  ` Deciphering the functions of brain and mind demands improved methods for visualizing , monitoring , and manipulating the activity of neural circuits in natural settings , ' says Thomas M. Jessell , co-director of the Zuckerman Institute and Claire Tow Professor of Motor Neuron Disorders .  ` Hillman 's sophistication in optical physics has led her to develop a new imaging technique that permits large-scale detection of neuronal firing in three-dimensional brain tissues .  ` This methodological advance offers the potential to unlock the secrets of brain activity in ways barely imaginable a few years ago .

8	The family of Stephen Collins fear the 7th Heaven star is on the brink of suicide over shocking allegations he molested several underage girls .  The actor , who played a beloved pastor on the hit family friendly show , has been left distraught after his taped confessions made during a marriage therapy session were made public .  Now those closest to the 67-year-old are deeply concerned the star has hit rock bottom and fear he may harm himself .  Scroll down for videos  Broken trust : In bombshell divorce documents obtained by MailOnline , Stephen Collins estranged wife Faye Grant claims the actor used his celebrity status to prey on underage girls and ` engender the trust of the families of the children he molested ' in a decade of abuse . Grant has also come out to say Collins even had incestuous thoughts about their only child when she was pregnant  Before the storm : Collins flew from New York to Los Angeles on Monday , the day before the child molestation allegations surfaced  Shock : 7th Heaven cast members ca n't believe the claims against the TV dad , who played Rev Eric Camden on the long-running family drama about parents raising seven children . The cast included  left to right  are David Gallagher , Jessica Biel , Barry Watson , Beverly Mitchell , Mackenzie Rosman  seated with dog Happy  , Catherine Hicks and Stephen Collins  Family reunion : Last month Collins tweeted this photo of a cast reunion dinner attended by his former co-star Jessica Biel , center  ` His family by no means condone what he 's said to have done , but it does n't stop them worrying about him , ' a close family friend told MailOnline .  ` They fear he could take his own life . That 's how low he is right now . No one wants to leave him by himself . '  His estranged wife Faye Grant has now claimed that Collins even had incestuous thoughts about their only child when she was pregnant .  She says just before giving birth , he told her how glad he was they were having a girl , who they named Kate , instead of a boy who he may have abused .  ` The comment you made just before I gave birth to our daughter when you said you hoped we did n't have a little boy , because `` you just did n't know if you could keep his little penis out of your mouth '' was indication enough that you were sick , ' Grant wrote in an email obtained by TMZ .  ' I should have followed my gut then , and then again 14 years ago , and kicked your ass to the curb , ' she added .  But a source close to Collins told the gossip site that the allegations are ` absolutely untrue , ' that he never received that email and Grant never brought these claims up during their contentious divorce proceedings .  According to court papers obtained by MailOnline , Grant is attempting to indemnify herself and the divorce settlement from settlement any civil action stemming from the pediphelia charges .  Ar stake is property worth $ 13million including over $ 5 million in real estate and Collins ' $ 100,000 worth of vintage guitars .  On top of that , a Massachusetts woman who worked as a nanny in New York in the 1990s , in the same building as Collins , has come forward to reveal his strange daily visits in pajamas and the ` semi-pornographic novel ' he was writing .  The woman named Ilene called into Boston radio station Mix 104.1 Wednesday morning .  The family source says cast and crew of 7th Heaven - the popular long-running family drama which ended in 2007 - are in ` shock ' over the bombshell claims .  Neighbor tweets : Collins ' neighbor , former Baywatch star and Playboy model Donna D'Errico , tweeted just after 8pm pacific time that the actor shot himself  Oops : After it was determined that there was no shotgun fire or suicide last night , D'Errico left a statement taped to her door stating her side of what she did and asking for privacy  False alarm : Police arrived at a house where Stephen Collins was believed to be staying in Tarzana , California , in response to the false report  In an interview with MailOnline , a cast member , who asked not to be identified , said , ` I 'm very confused right now . Knowing Stephen the way I do , I find it hard to put this together .  ` He was n't that guy . He was n't someone with secrets and angst . He was always very present with us . Fun and teasing . All we did is laugh all day long at work and a lot of it was because of him . He 's not that guy to me .  ` He took care of me and all of us during those years . He really was a father figure . Taught us to read music a little bit and would make up songs for any occasion for us . He was our glue that held us together . Our rock .  ` We all had dinner together a few months ago . If this is true , it 's disturbing because there was no outside appearance of problems . He never did anything sneaky when I knew him and I saw him every day .  ` It must be buried in him . I wish him the best of luck to make it through this . I hope he goes to rehab and comes out the same role model rock star that we know him as . '  Collins , who famously played Reverend Eric Camden , the virtuous father-of-seven , is currently being investigated for child molestation .  An NYPD official confirmed to MailOnline that they had received a complaint and the Special Victims Squad is investigating .  And the LAPD is also reviewing their own 2012 investigation into Collins , and will be collaborating with New York authorities .  Law enforcement in California received the therapy session recordings two years ago but closed their case after finding ` no verified victim ' .  In the recorded therapy session , Collins seemingly admits that he exposed himself to several young girls between the ages of 10 and 13 in both Los Angeles and New York .  Leering : Collins starred in the 1996 Lifetime movie The Babysitter 's Seduction in which he played a recently widowed dad who becomes obsessed with his childrens ' babysitter , played by Keri Russell  Too young : The dirty dalliance between Felicity 's Keri Russell and Reverend Camden from 7th Heaven ended badly  Following the tapes released by TMZ on Tuesday , Collins life and career have been falling apart as he resigned from his position on the Screen Actors Guild board and was fired from the film Ted 2 . Reruns of 7th Heaven are not being broadcast and he will no longer appear on the hit TV show Scandal .  LAPD officers rushed to Tarzana , California , after getting a 911 call about a shot fired inside Collins ' house last night . Collins ' neighbor , former Playboy model and Baywatch star Donna D'Errico , tweeted just after 8pm PT that the actor shot himself  It turned out to be a false alarm sparked by a member of the media who heard a loud pop  The actor allegedly made a written confession to his now ex-wife Faye Grant in 2012 , which sparked the therapy session .  Grant secretly recorded the session under the advisement of her lawyer , who told her it was legal in California to record conversations in order to gather evidence on a person who has committed a violent felony .  And in explosive court documents Grant reveals she was ` sickened ' after her husband allegedly confessed to living a vile ` secret life ' in which he abused several children .  She claims the actor used his celebrity status to prey on underage girls and ` engender the trust of the families of the children he molested ' in a decade of abuse .  Ironically Collins starred in the 1996 Lifetime movie The Babysitter 's Seduction in which he played a recently widowed dad who becomes obsessed with his childrens ' teenage babysitter , played by Keri Russell .  Sex tape : Collins ' estranged wife Faye Grant secretly recorded the session with her therapist in which he admitted to sexually abusing three underage girls  Devastated Grant also revealed Collins was treated for a sex addiction and was seeing a ` sexual dysfunction ' therapist , but he refused to seek proper help or hospitalization for his ` predilection towards children ' , she said .  `` The family feels absolutely betrayed by him . He 's not the man they all thought he was and that 's incredibly hurtful and confusing , ' said the family source .  `` With everything that has come to light they fear there could be other victims . There 's so much that he has already hidden from everyone he 's worked and lived with , they do n't know what could come out next . Some are even wondering if he admitted everything he 's done on those tapes , or if there 's more he 's keeping secret .  `` The family are mortified and embarrassed . They remain concerned however for Stephen because they now know he has deep seeded issues . ''  Yesterday cast and crew of 7th Heaven were said to be reeling over the news .  The family source , who knows several cast members and often visited the 7th Heaven set , said : ` No one had any idea . They had a reunion just last month and everyone loved it .  ` There were never any signs Stephen had these issues . No one ever suspected a thing .  ` Everyone who has worked with him has said he 's amazing and lovely and one of the nicest guys ever .  ` It 's like the neighbors of the serial killer with bodies buried in the basement who always say , ` He was always such a nice guy ' .  ` We are all blown away by the revelations .

9	Southampton midfielder Steven Davis was sad to see Mauricio Pochettino leave for Tottenham , but does not believe it represents the end of the club 's rise to prominence .  Saints excelled under Pochettino last season , finishing in eighth place in the Barclays Premier League and drawing admiring glances across the board for their style of play .  Such success was always likely to attract interest from elsewhere and , like their former manager , the likes of Adam Lallana , Luke Shaw and Jay Rodriguez have all been linked with high-profile transfers this summer.VIDEO Scroll down to see Mauricio Pochettino confirmed as new Tottenham manager  Belief : Steven Davis reckons that Southampton can continue to progress without Mauricio Pochettino  Unveiled : Mauricio Pochettino has made the move from Southampton to Tottenham  Northern Ireland captain Davis , who found out about Pochettino 's departure while on international duty in Uruguay , admits it is a tough time but expects the structure that exists at St Mary 's to continue yielding benefits .  ` It 's a blow for everybody to lose him , you ca n't really get away from that , and the players all loved working for him , ' said Davis .  ` He pushed us on from where we were at before he came in ; everyone personally improved , results improved as well and things were looking bright for the future .  ` It 's disappointing but at the same time I do n't think it will affect the club in terms of progression because there is still a lot of growth left in the team .  ` The club has come a long way in the last five years and the blueprint has been evident under each and every manager .  ` There is no reason why that should stop now and everyone will want to get going forward to achieve our goals . '  Moving : Luke Shaw and Adam Lallana are two of Southampton 's young stars that have been tipped for a move  Outgoing : And Jay Rodriguez would have been another were it not for his injury  Whether Southampton continue to grow and defy expectations is likely to depend in large part on how successful they are in rebuffing interest in their star assets from the likes of Manchester United , Liverpool and now Pochettino 's Tottenham .  Dream moves for the likes of Shaw and Lallana to Old Trafford and Anfield have been mooted for some time now , but Davis is not treating their departures as a done deals .  ` I 'm sure the owners will be doing their utmost now to get the best person possible in and ensure the we can keep the squad together , ' he said .  ` There 's obviously rumours even before the manager left and that was well documented but that was based on us having a really good season .  ` You ca n't stop that and it 's always difficult if a top four club comes in to keep a hold of them , but I always felt all the players bought into what the club is trying to achieve and everyone is happy there .  Battler : Davis fighting West Brom 's Youssouf Mulumbu  left  and James Morrison for the ball  ' I hope that is still the case and all the lads really enjoy working with each other and trying to push the club forward . '  Davis will lead his country out against England 's World Cup Group D opponents Uruguay on Friday , and has vowed to pass any nuggets of information on to his friends in Roy Hodgson 's squad .  ` Nobody has asked me just yet to get information on Uruguay but I was texting Adam Lallana , just talking about the games coming up and how things were going , '' he said .  ` If there is anything I can tell him , Ricky Lambert or Luke to help them then of course I will but I have no doubt they will be well briefed when it comes to their game with Uruguay .

'  John McArdle , from anti-disability discrimination campaign Black Triangle , said : ` Every day our campaign receives more messages from desperate people who are on the brink of suicide .  ` This government is killing disabled people , and we must stand together and say enough is enough . '  Protestors gather in Trafalgar Square to protest against the policy . The majority of the protests have been organised by Labour Left think tank with others involving the SNP , Greens and SWP together with various Trades Councils and Trade Unions  Angry protestors paraded through London , days before the new cut will come into effect  Some hid their faces behind masks , which have been used by internet hackers . Thousands protested in Trafalgar Square as charity Crisis warned that the cuts would be devastating  Protestors called Iain Duncan Smith a ` ratbag '  Bill Scott , from disability campaign group Inclusion Scotland , said two-thirds of UK properties affected house a disabled person , rising to four-fifths in Scotland .  ` The purpose of an equality impact assessment is to find out and then change your policy so it does n't disproportionately impact on the vulnerable , ' he said .  ` Instead , the UK Government went ahead and implemented that policy completely unchanged . It is a disgrace that this government chose to attack disabled people . '  Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith was branded a ` ratbag ' by a heckler during his visit to Edinburgh last week .  The insult was adopted liberally at today 's march , with protesters wearing t-shirts and waving placards with the word ` ratbag ' superimposed over Mr Duncan Smith ` s face .  Kelly Parry , representing the National Union of Students , said : ` He is a ratbag . The cuts that are going to come in are going to disproportionately affect women .  ` We need to fight back so that never again will the people of this country be robbed by Westminster . '  In a statement of support for the marchers , SNP MSP Linda Fabiani said : ` The Scottish Government has brought in mitigation measures and has made a firm commitment to scrap the policy in an independent Scotland .  ` There is no doubt that the bedroom tax is an abhorrent policy and the level of outrage surrounding what is being imposed is entirely justified . '  The raft of Government welfare cuts that come into effect next week will heap misery on the UK 's poorest families , a charity warned today .  Queues at food banks are poised to get longer and homelessness is expected to increase , according to Crisis .  Millions of homes will be hit by the combination of reforms that comes in from April , with low-paid workers , the unemployed and disabled people bearing the brunt of the cuts , it added .  Hundreds of people took to Edinburgh 's streets to protest against the introduction of the so-called Bedroom Tax  Council tax benefit , which covers some or all of the cost of the bill for struggling families , will be replaced by a new system that will be run by English local authorities but on 10 per cent less funding .  Pensioners are protected under the changes but that is expected to mean a bigger burden on poor working age adults .  Crisis said it also had ` serious concerns ' about the replacement of disability living allowance  DLA  with a personal independence payment  PIP  , claiming the the assessment process for the new benefit will exclude many disabled people who need support .  Restrictions on the uprating of a number of welfare payments will also hit millions of households , it warned .  Crisis chief executive Leslie Morphy , said : ` Our poorest households face a bleak April as they struggle to budget for all these cuts coming at once . People are already cutting back on the essentials of food and heating but there is only so much they can do .  ` The result will be misery - cold rooms , longer queues at food banks , broken families , missed rent payments and yet more people facing homelessness - devastating for those directly affected , but bad for us all .

16	It took only one ball of the first one-day international against Australia on Friday for England to be handed a rude reminder of the size of the task that awaits them here in the tri-series and the World Cup that follows .  Once Ian Bell , who made 187 just two days ago , was trapped lbw by a rapid Mitchell Starc at the Sydney Cricket Ground , much of the optimism England garnered from two near perfect warm-up performances began to evaporate .  When James Taylor followed two balls later and England then crashed to 33 for four it seemed as though this was simply a continuation of the Ashes tour from hell that reached its nadir on this same famous old ground a year ago .  Ian Bell  left  was dismissed off the bowling of Mitchell Starc  centre  in the first ball of the match  Pat Cummins  second left  celebrates taking the wicket of Joe Root , who was caught behind  Jos Buttler  left  appeals unsuccessfully for the wicket of David Warner , who went on to reach a century  Thank heavens then for Eoin Morgan who made a welcome return to form and once again appeared galvanised by high office as he single-handedly saved England from one of the total humiliations common place here last winter .  Yet a century from the new England one-day captain that augers well for the battles ahead was never going to be enough to stop Australia showing that they will be very much the team to beat in the World Cup that begins next month .  Once David Warner got in the groove that tormented England all too often during the 5-0 thrashing Australia 's domination was clear against an attack worryingly lacking in variation and incapable of defending a sub-standard 234 .  As it was , Australia cruised to a win so comfortable they were able to gain a bonus point and demonstrated that they remain a formidable one-day machine even without injured captain Michael Clarke and the rested Mitchell Johnson .  Eoin Morgan , England 's one-day captain , top scored for the visitors with 121 runs against Australia  Warner bats during the opening match of the One Day International Tri Series between Australia and England  Warner and Aaron Finch  right  , Australia 's opening batsman against England , take to the field on Friday  Back to the drawing board ? Not really , because England were always likely to be a one-day work in progress here with only a puncher 's chance of competing for a tri-series that also includes India and the premier 50-overs tournament .  Yet they will want to do much better than this , starting when they meet that other one-day powerhouse in India in Brisbane on Tuesday and then when they face Australia yet again in Hobart next Friday .  It was somehow inevitable that Bell would fail here after showing against a Prime Minister 's XI that he can produce the type of dynamic , substantial innings that has been beyond so many Englishmen in 50-over cricket .  England may have breathed a sigh of relief that they did not have to face Johnson here but instead came another left-arm bowler with the pace , hostility and skill to rip the heart out of their innings before it had barely begun .  England 's Chris Woakes  third left  celebrates with his team-mates after taking the wicket of Finch  left   Morgan proved his worth as England 's one-day captain when he came in at five to top score for the visitors  Ravi Bopara  right  plays a sweep shot on his way to 13 runs off 18 balls for England against Australia  Starc appears to have added the priceless ability to swing the ball back into right-handers to his armoury and here he was simply too quick for both Bell and Taylor as England made the worst possible start to their busiest ever year .  There was a suspicion that Bell may have got an inside edge onto his pad but the replays were inconclusive and not even the Decision Review System that will not be used in this tri-series at India 's insistence would have saved him .  By the time Morgan came to the crease England were in disarray -- welcome to the captaincy , Eoin -- but at least he was able to steady his ship and hit his first century since this time last year in Brisbane .  It was desperately needed . No-one else had an answer to Starc , the equally rapid Pat Cummins , the left-arm variations of James Faulkner and even the mediocre spinner in Xavier Doherty who England were unable to attack .  Shane Watson , Australia 's number three , plays a shot ... he eventually scored 16 runs off 20 balls for the hosts  Steve Smith watches on as his shot flies away towards the boundary at the Sydney Cricket Ground  Morgan leads the England players on to the field as a St George 's Cross flies in the background  When Chris Jordan hung around with his captain long enough to add 56 for the eighth wicket England at least looked like they would reach the relative riches of 250 and give themselves something to bowl at .  But Starc returned to dismiss Morgan for 121 and last man Steven Finn in successive balls and England had wasted 13 deliveries after being bowled out within 50 overs for the 10th time in their last 13 one-day internationals .  Where Australia have plenty of bowling options Morgan had no choice other than to rely an attack lacking a left-armer of his own and even their main one-day spinner in James Tredwell , surprisingly left out on a worn SCG pitch .  Warner 's one-day record pales into insignificance compared to his Test and Twenty20 statistics but he loves being a thorn in England 's side and once he had negotiated the two new balls there was absolutely no shifting him .  Morgan gathered his England squad together to give a team-talk before they took to the field  Fans dressed up in the sun to enjoy the One Day International match of Australia against England  A view of the MA Noble and Don Bradman Stand shows the ground bathed in sunshine on Friday  England left out Jimmy Anderson to give him more time to recover from his knee problem but in his place Finn was again a shadow of the bowler who looked among the best one-day performers in the world in New Zealand in 2013 .  Clearly the problems that led to Finn being sent home from the Ashes tour with his action in disarray have not totally been solved yet and Finn did well to escape injury when he clattered into the stumps after losing his footing .  The much improved Chris Woakes was quicker than Finn and provided encouragement with four wickets but the decision to keep Stuart Broad away from the new balls suggests he too has not fully recovered from knee surgery .  The end came with more than 10 overs to spare but only three wickets in hand after Warner , who could have been given out lbw to Moeen Ali on 51 , had been dismissed for 127 within sight of the winning post . England will hope Australia prove just as difficult to beat when they face India in Melbourne on Sunday , leaving them to battle it out with MS Dhoni 's side for a place in the final .  Yes , this is a reality check but it was always expecting a lot for England to hit the ground running against Australia in this series . At least Morgan , who must have a good World Cup for England to have any chance , is back in business .    	  England won the toss and opted to bat first against Australia in Sydney    It started badly for the tourists as Ian Bell was bowled with the first delivery    And it went from bad to worse as James Taylor was given out lbw after the third ball , leaving England struggling on 0-2    Eoin Morgan came in with England on 12-3 , and top scored with 121    England posted 243 all out in just shy of 48 overs against Australia    Australia opener David Warner impressed as he raced to a century    Warner top scored with 127 before being caught by Bell late on    Australia confirmed the victory with 61 balls remaining in the innings	It took only one ball of the first one-day international against Australia on Friday for England to be handed a rude reminder of the size of the task that awaits them here in the tri-series and the World Cup that follows .

17	Two families have renewed their campaign to find two teenage girls who vanished on Halloween 45 years ago today .  Patricia Spencer , 17 , and her 15-year-old friend Pamela Hobley went missing on October 31 , 1969 after going to a high school football game in Oscoda , Michigan .  The girls had told family and friends that they were then heading to a Halloween party - but never showed up .  Scroll down for video  Pamela Hobley , 15 ,  left  and Patricia Spencer , 17 ,  right  went missing on October 31 , 1969 after going to a high school football game in Oscoda , Michigan  The girls , who did not usually hang out together , relatives said , left the school early on Halloween to go to a party but never arrived  Oscoda High School was subject to a bomb threat that day and family members believed that the girls may have left school early that afternoon .  According to Missing Persons of America , the girls were not usually known to hang out together .  Decades after the mysterious disappearance , relatives of the young women refuse to give up hope .  Pamela 's sister , Mary Buehrle , told 48 Hours ' Crimesider : ' I ca n't move on . I just hope that someone knows something and will finally have the guts to say something . '  Ms Buehrle said she remembered that night as she had gone trick-or-treating with her mother and other sisters .  She said her mother , a single mom , was told by Pamela that she was going to a Halloween party with her friends and boyfriend , to whom she had recently become engaged .  Patricia 's sister told the show that she believed the two girls were picked up by the wrong person and were murdered .  Oscoda Township Police Chief Mark David , who took over the case in 2010 , also believes that the girls may have been victims of foul play .  He said that he wanted to bring the girls home to give their families closure after almost half a century of not knowing .  Pamela 's mother died without ever finding out what had happened to her daughter , Ms Buehrle said .  Chief David has combed over hundreds of old statements and tips involving the case that were not followed up upon at the time . He believes that the investigation got off to a slow start because the girls were deemed runaways .  Pamela Hobley  pictured left  would now be 60 and Patricia Spencer  right  would be 61 . They are seen in age-progression photographs created by the National Center For Missing Children  Pamela Hobley 's sister , Mary Buehrle , pictured , said that she believes someone murdered her sister and her friend 45 yeras ago  The chief said that when he was a teenager it was rumored that the girls had been buried under a barn in Wilber Township , around 11 miles from Oscoda .  The tip was never acted upon , Chief David discovered after becoming police chief . Police search teams with cadaver dogs went to the barn but nothing was discovered .  Another tip from a witness said that he had given the girls a ride in his car but that turned out to be false .  Last year , a new tip emerged from a witness who said that he given the girls a ride and left them at a gas station on River Road .  When they were last seen , Miss Hobley was wearing a white fake fur coat wit brown fur trim , a long-sleeved blouse with ruffled cuffs and a brown and white plaid skirt , white kneesocks and shoes with a chunky heel . She had brown hair , brown eyes , a scar on her nose and a birthmark on the left corner of her mouth .  Patricia Spencer has brown hair and blue eyes and wears glasses .

18	Dozens of angry Filipinos gathered outside a military base where a young American soldier is being held accused of murdering a transgender woman , in a protest which ended in the victim 's family scaling the fence  The boyfriend and sister of Jennifer Laude , 26 , climbed into the military base in Manila , demanding to see the teenage U.S. Marine accused of her murder .  Earlier this week , the U.S. military turned over Marine Pfc. Joseph Scott Pemberton , 19 , from New Bedford , Massachusetts , to the Philippine military 's main camp .  Protest : Marilou Laude , the sister of murdered Filipina Jennifer Laude , climbs the gate of the facility where PfC Joseph Scott Pemberton is detained at the Armed Forces of the Philippine  AFP  headquarters in Manila  However , Jennifer Laude 's family have expressed their anger at Pemberton being guarded by U.S. forces at the base and yesterday gathered outside the base , demanding proof that the teenage marine was really kept there .  Marilou Laude , the sister of Jennifer , who was born Jefferey , climbed over the fence and into the base and was swiftly captured by guards .  Jennifer Laude 's German boyfriend Marc Susselbeck also jumped over the fence , and was seen pushing an army guard .  Laude , who was born Jeffrey , was found dead in a hotel in Olongapo City , around two hours drive from Manila , on October 11 .  Anger : German Marc Susselbeck , Laude 's boyfriend , follows over the gates as the family demands to see the teenage U.S. soldier accused of killing transgender Jennifer  Action : Susselbeck pushed past one of the Filipino guards in an attempt to get access to the base  Eyewitnesses say Pemberton met her in a nightclub and did n't know she was transgender until they were in a hotel room .  Killed : Transgender Jennifer Laude , 26 , was found dead in a hotel in Olongapo City  Laude , who was said to have been unemployed and living off a monthly allowance from Susselbeck , was later found strangled to death there , her head in a toilet bowl .  Pemberton was detained on board the USS Peleliu at the Subic Bay Freeport , about 50 miles northwest of Manila , after he was implicated in the death .  Pemberton 's transfer by helicopter to Manila early Wednesday was agreed by the U.S. and the Philippines , Philippine military chief of staff Gen. Gregorio Pio Catapang told a news conference .  He said that Pemberton will be detained in an air-conditioned van , directly guarded by U.S. Marines while Philippine military guards will be posted outside the compound , he said .  ` They agreed to put him in a facility which will pass U.S. custodial standards , ' Philippine Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin said .  ` We 're happy with this because he 's a suspect in a crime that was committed in our country . '  Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario , who has described Laude 's death as tragic , said that the arrangement showed ` mechanisms are in place so that justice can be served , ' adding there was strong cooperation between the treaty allies .  Philippine and U.S. authorities engaged in a high-profile custody battle over another U.S. Marine , Daniel Smith , who was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison on charges of raping a Filipino woman after a night of drinking in 2005 , also at the Subic freeport .  Accused : U.S. marine Joseph Scott Pemberton , 19 , from Massachusetts is accused of strangling Laude , 26  Smith was held at the U.S. Embassy in Manila until a Philippine appeals court overturned his conviction in 2009 , allowing him to leave the country amid anti-U.S. protests .  In the latest case , Philippine police and witnesses said Pemberton and Laude met at a bar in the city of Olongapo on October 11 , then went to a hotelroom where Laude 's body was later found in the bathroom .  She had apparently been drowned in the toilet bowl , according to police Chief Inspector Gil Domingo .  U.S. Pacific Commander Adm. Samuel Locklear has ordered Pemberton 's amphibious assault ship , which joined large-scale combat exercises with Filipino forces that ended October 10 , to stay in the Philippines until the investigation was completed .  Under the Visiting Forces Agreement , which allows U.S. forces to conduct combat drills in the country , the Philippines can prosecute American service members , but the U.S. has custody over them ` from the commission of the offense until completion of all judicial proceedings .

Left-wing activists and nationalist Filipinos have cited the custody provision as proof that the accord was lopsided in favor of the U.S. and undermines the sovereignty of the country , which was an American colony until 1946 .  Left-wing groups have staged small protests at the U.S. Embassy in Manila and at the Subic wharf where the USS Peleliu is moored , demanding Washington to turn over Pemberton to Philippine authorities for prosecution and detention and calling for the 1998 agreement 's abrogation .  President Benigno Aquino III on Monday defended the agreement , saying a crime can happen anywhere and ` the sin of one person ' should not reflect on the entire country .  U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday that Washington seeks no special privilege for the suspect but only protection of his rights .

19	By Jill Reilly  Two inmates have died and more than a hundred have been injured after an apparent gas explosion at a jail in northern Florida .  The blast partly leveled the four-story Escambia County Jail 's central booking facility , which held roughly 600 inmates , at about 11 p.m. , county spokeswoman Kathleen Castro .  Roughly 100 -150 inmates and correctional officers were hurt she said , as she confirmed two people had died .  The injured were brought to hospitals and the uninjured inmates were brought to jails in neighboring counties , Castro said .  Castro described a frenetic scene where officials were scrambling to get people out of the building , provide medical care , and working to make sure inmates were detained and routed to other facilities .  She said there was a partial building collapse , a roof collapse and that it is believed that the walls are unstable in the facility .  The explosion shook houses for several blocks and the areas has been quarantined by Sheriff 's Office personnel .  Sacred Heart Hospital spokesman Mike Burke told Pensacola News Journal that 31 people were brought to the hospital by ambulances and law enforcement officers are at the hospital providing security as the inmates are being treated .  Kendrick Doidge said West Florida Hospital treated 37 inmates in the emergency room and all have been released back into the custody of the Escambia County Sheriff 's Office .  An updated statement on the Escambia County website later made no mention of gas , saying only it was an ` apparent explosion ' after reporting earlier it was ` an apparent gas explosion ' .  Castro did n't know if flooding in the area was a factor but says the jail did get extensive flooding during heavy rains that drenched the region Tuesday and Wednesday .

20	9,513 items of clothing are disposed of every five minutes  Louise Roe and Zara Martin join Oxfam and M&S to help combat this  By Bianca London  PUBLISHED :  10:43 EST , 10 September 2012   |  UPDATED :  11:24 EST , 10 September 2012  With a new season comes a new wardrobe and many fashionistas live by the motto ` out with the old and in with the new . '  The seasonal shift is often the catalyst for many to clear their summer wardrobes to get rid of last season 's trends and make space for new garments .  But unbeknown to many , a staggering 9,513 items of clothing are disposed of every five minutes by the British public .  Marks and Spencer have joined with Oxfam to encourage women to recycle their old clothes  So , in charitable fashion , high-street giant Marks and Spencer have joined forces with Oxfam to launch a campaign which aims to end the disposal of this many clothes .  ` Shwopping ' is the revolutionary sustainable fashion initiative created by M&S and Oxfam , asking consumers to adopt a ` buy one , give one ' mentality when shopping and encourage greater sustainability on the high street .  The campaign aims to put an end to the one billion items currently ending up in landfill every year .  All M&S clothing stores now accept used and unwanted items of clothing from any brand , all year round with items going to Oxfam to be resold , re-used or recycled .  The campaign aims to put an end to the one billion items currently ending up in landfill every year  The partners have enlisted the help of two ` Queens of Style ' to help the British public clear out their wardrobe ahead of the new autumn season and encourage them to give their unwanted items of clothing a future life through the retailer 's shwopping initiative .  US Glamour magazine 's Fashion Editor-at-Large , Louise Roe and TV presenter Zara Martin have each given a clear step-by-step guide to consumers to give their wardrobe a diet and help the environment at the same time .  Louise Roe said : ` Be brutal , throw out anything you have n't worn in two years or more . If you have n't been attracted to it in that long , you never will be -- but someone else might ! '  Zara Martin sent a clear message to those thinking that they will one day fit into their treasured old items again : ` It does n't fit anymore , move on . '  Past ` on trend ' items of clothing have also been dealt a blow with Roe stating : ` Any trends that you wore the first time that they were in fashion  i.e. 70 's flares , 80 's shoulder pads  rarely work again on you decades later , unless it 's a timeless evening piece . '  Martin added : ` You tried the trend . RIP . Now , remove the remnants . '  Louise Roe gives her top tips on how to be brutal with your clothes  Spend a Sunday afternoon giving your wardrobe some rehab - you ca n't do this half-heartedly . So get the whole lot out on your bed and buy new hangers , drawer separators , boxes to label , it 'll feel like a totally fresh start and you might find some hidden gems  Throw out anything you have n't worn in two years or more . If you have n't been attracted to it in that long , you never will be .  If a garment is two or more sizes too small or too big - chuck it . You do n't need visual reminders of how skinny or chubby you used to be . Better to love dressing the body you have now !  Do n't be too sentimental . Of course , hang onto anything that makes you well up at the thought of losing it , but clinging onto garments because they remind you of ex-boyfriends or drunken nights at university , are just not worth it .  Any trends that you wore the first time that they were in fashion  ie . 70 's flares , 80 's shoulder pads  rarely works again on you decades later , unless it 's a more timeless evening piece . I hate to be brutal , but if you were rocking bright eye shadows and neon 's in the 80 's , you should n't be rocking them out again now !  ` If it does n't fit anymore , move on ' says Zara Martin  Stop being a hoarder : If you have clothing with the labels still on it hanging in your closet , the general rule is you 're probably never going to wear it . Admit it was a mistake and get rid .  It does n't fit anymore , move on : We all have a pair of jeans lurking somewhere deep within our wardrobes that we wish we could still fit into - ` Inspiration jeans ' , if you will . In reality , they serve as a constant reminder of the good times  before we discovered Krispy Kreme  . Say bye-bye , embrace the ones that do fit AND the booty !  Stick to what you know : You tried the Bo-Ho  insert equivalent  ` trend ' . RIP . Now , remove the remnants .  Quality , not quantity : One well-cut jacket is infinitely better than 3-5 mediocre ones . Invest in quality , timeless pieces that you can enjoy wearing over and over again .  There are no seasons : We live in the UK . Bummer for us that summer looks like winter and vice versa .

21	By Lizzie Edmonds  PUBLISHED :   14:33 EST , 2 February 2014    | UPDATED :   14:43 EST , 2 February 2014  Rich foreigners should be restricted from buying houses in Britain and purchasing newbuild homes solely as an investment , a leading think-tank has said .  Wealthy overseas investors are adding to ` rampant house price inflation ' , driving up prices and forcing millions of middle and low UK earners out of the property market , Civitas has said .  The think-tank has called on ministers to adopt a scheme to stop existing homes being sold to those from outside the EU .  It also proposes foreigners should only be allowed to buy new homes if they prove their investment would lead to more properties being built .  Money is no object : Businessman Roman Abramovich  left  and fashion designer Dasha Zhukova who both live in London  It would therefore stop foreign investors such as Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich from adding to his multi-million pound collection of London homes .  Investment from China , Malaysia and Singapore will also be reduced under the plans , it is hoped .  The report , called Finding Shelter , revealed that 85 per cent of London homes in 2012 were bought by foreign investors . Two thirds of those were bought solely as investments and were not lived in .  Savills estate agent found of the # 7 billion spent on top-end London properties , just 20 per cent was spent by those living in the UK last year .  Civitas says foreign buyers are not just acquiring high-value London properties - but also mid-market new homes .  They say 27 per cent of new builds in central London were bought by UK citizens , with more than half sold to those from Singapore , Hong Kong , China and Russia .  Exclusive : A 12-bedroom mansion on Kensington Palace Gardens which was bought by Britain multi-billionaire steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal  Embassy street : The Russian Ambassador 's official residenence on Kensington Palace Gardens  The report , to be release in full tomorrow , said : ` The UK property market is being use as an investment vehicle by the global super-rich - and increasingly the simply the well-to-do .  ` It is good news for estate agents ... But it is not good for those already being priced out at the bottom .  It added foreign investments are ` distorting housebuilding priorities with developers disproportionately attracted to high value developments while ignoring the under supply at lower levels of the market . '  The paper , co-written by director of Civitas David Green and director of communications at the body Daniel Bentley , added : ` London property is now seen for many in terms of its investment potential , as a safe haven for cash in an unstable global economic climate , rather than something that should be meeting a basic social need for the capital 's residents .  Heritage : The exclusive No 12A Kensington Palace Gardens was given to Nepal in 1937 as a thank you for the work of their Gurkhas in the British armed forces  Fit for an oligarch : Roman Abramovich 's house in Knightsbridge , London  ` For too many it is providing financial shelter rather than human shelter . '  The restrictions are similar to a scheme currently in force in Australia , where all non-residents and holders of short-term visas must apply to the country 's Foreign Investment Review Board  FIRB  .  They can not purchase an existing home - but can buy a new property provided they can satisfy the FIRB that the housing stock has increased .  Civitas says similar controls are used in Singapore , Switzerland and Denmark .  Shadow London minister Sadiq Khan told The Observer : ` London is in the middle of a severe housing crisis , yet there are around 50,000 empty homes .  A home fit for a prince : Saudi prince Abdul Aziz bin Fahd was reported to be selling his luxury London mansion in Kensington Palace Gardens - known as Billionaire 's Row - which is estimated to be worth # 150million  ` We must stop housing that 's built as family homes being used instead as a piggy bank for the world 's wealthiest people . '  Rather than blaming the property boom on foreign buyers , some analysts have criticised the Government 's flagship Help to Buy scheme for pushing up demand in the housing market .  The scheme gives people with only low deposits saved a helping hand to get on to the property ladder .  They say this imbalance between demand and supply is fuelling an upward pressure on prices .  Recent Land Registry figures showed that house prices in London increased at more than double the rate of the rest of the UK over last year .  London house prices leapt by 11.2 per cent over 2013 to reach # 403,792 on average , while prices across England and Wales generally lifted by 4.4 per cent in the 12 months to December to reach # 167,353 .

Michael Bennison , 28 , was arrested in York yesterday evening following a nationwide manhunt .  Bennison , who was homeless , had spent two weeks on the run over a separate alleged assault and drug dealing .  However on Friday he is believed to have attacked his 27-year-old girlfriend , allegedly stabbing her and puncturing one of her lungs in a cul-de-sac in Huntington , York .  She was taken to York District Hospital to be treated for her injuries and doctors say she is in a stable condition after being treated for multiple wounds .  Following the alleged stabbing , a nationwide police manhunt was launched for Bennison after it was feared he had left the city .  However , he remained in York and was arrested at a house near to where the woman was attacked on suspicion of attempted murder , possession of drugs with intent to supply and assault .  Detective Inspector Shaun Page , of North Yorkshire Police , said : ' I would like to convey my thanks to the media and the many members of the public who have contributed to the search and helped us to locate Bennison . '  Bennison had escaped jail in October 2010 after an assault on a woman left her scarred for life . He was sentenced to an 11-month suspended sentence .

Susan Taylor , 34 , collapsed just one mile from the French coast as she swam under the guidance of the Channel Swimming Association , which officially authorises attempts , on Sunday July 14 .  Mrs Taylor , from Barwell , Leicsester , was pulled from the water and on to a support boat by her brother David , a paramedic , who battled to save her life before she was taken to hospital in nearby Boulogne-sur-Mer , where she was later pronounced dead .  Her death prompted thousands of people to donate to Mrs Taylor 's two fundraising pages , in support of Rainbows Hospice for Children and Young People and Diabetes UK .  However , it has now emerged one donation to Rainbows , of # 150,000 , was a fake - something the charity described as an ` appalling act at such a tragic and emotional time ' .  It is believed a similar hoax pledge was also made to Diabetes UK .  In a statement , Mrs Taylor 's family said : ' -LSB- We -RSB- were obviously delighted when news of a donation pledge of # 300,000 to the two charities was announced .  ` Unfortunately , it would appear that this pledge was bogus since the funds have failed to materialise in the charities ' accounts .  ' -LSB- We -RSB- are disappointed and upset that an individual has taken actions which have misled the family and Susan 's chosen charities in this way .  Devastated : Susan Taylor 's husband Stephen  pictured at a Christmas party  was on the support boat  Brave : Mrs Taylor , 34 , wanted to emulate David Walliams ' charity swim but died one mile from France  Fundraiser : David Walliams , pictured during his 2006 Channel swim , is believed to have donated # 1,000  ` The family wish to emphasise that they are extremely grateful for the support of members of the public and the generosity they have shown in supporting Susan 's legacy .  ` We do not intend to allow the actions of one person to detract from what Susan has accomplished and the pride we feel for her . '  Legitimate donations to Mrs Taylor 's fundraising pages have soared to more than # 70,000 in the days since her death .  Much-loved : Susan 's father described her as ` the best person in the world '  Dedicated : Mrs Taylor had spent 18 months preparing for her arduous challenge for two charities  Prepared : Mrs Taylor 's progress team posted this picture during her swim , writing : ` Easy way versus the hard way !!!!! Susan definitely deserves the easy way next time !!! She 's doing fab : '  Comedian David Walliams - who swam the Channel in 2006 - is believed to have pledged # 1,000 after a donation was made under the name of the Little Britain star with the message : ` Sending all my love to Susan 's family and friends ' .  Walliams tweeted later : ` Despite the shock & sadness , it 's good to see heroic Susan Taylor 's charity total rising . Please give what you can ... '  Mrs Taylor had given up her full-time job to carry out charitable work and was working part-time as an accountant , her family said .  An online map tracking Ms Taylor 's progress appeared to show that her support boat had suddenly sped up and sailed in a different direction towards land  Mrs Taylor was initially rescued from Wissant Bay near Cap Gris-Nez on the French coast  Before her solo attempt she told a newspaper that her training had been delayed a little by a shoulder injury and that she had put herself ` through hell ' training over the last year .  Geoff Ellis , chief executive at the Rainbows charity , condemned the hoax donations . He said : ` We are shocked that a person would carry out this appalling act at such a tragic and emotional time .  ` Susan devoted her life to Rainbows and since her sad passing , kind-hearted people - many of whom did not know Susan - have honoured her memory by pledging generous donations to her online fundraising page .  ` We have relayed the news to the family who are devastated that someone would exploit this heart-breaking situation .

For those of you who do n't know , Churchman is the person stood just to the right of Matthew Simmons - the target of Cantona 's fury that night - that night .  It 's not an exaggeration to say , it could have been her .  ` After it happened I remember looking down at my coat and seeing a scuff mark from Eric 's boot , that 's how close it was to being me , ' she said .  ' I just wanted to get out the way , you could see it in Eric 's eyes .  ` Could it have been me ? Absolutely .

Cantona reacted angrily to abuse from Palace fan Simmons  left  , Churchman can also be seen  centre   Stewards attempt to restrain the forward after his assault on the Palace supporter  But the seriousness of the implications following that night would soon dawn on her .  Churchman would become central to the subsequent court cases for Cantona and Simmons given her proximity to the incident .  She maintains the story Cantona was reacting to a racial slur from Simmons is one hard to believe given the noise reverberating around Selhurst Park in the seconds leading up to Cantona 's kick following the Frenchman 's sending off .  Not that is a defence of Simmons in anyway .  During his trial for threatening language and behaviour , Simmons launched himself at the prosecution after being found guilty .  Churchman , who was in court , recalls : ` It was a foolish act . The whole thing started with a kick from Cantona and that was how it ended with Simmons doing the same .  ` Twenty years on , do I ever pay Simmons a thought ? To be honest , no .  ` I 've heard he still goes to games sometimes , even though he has been banned from Selhurst Park . '  The French forward was found guilty of assault at Croydon Magistrates Court as a result of the incident  He was banned from English football by the FA for eight months and ordered to carry out community service  Cantona spent five years at Manchester United before retiring in 1997 at the age of 30    	  Eric Cantona kung-fu kicked a Crystal Palace fan in January 2015    Cathy Churchman was standing next to Matthew Simmons , who was kicked    The 65-year-old revealed she wants to draw a line under the incident	Cathy Churchman has been trying to draw a line under Eric Cantona 's kung-fu kick for 20 years . ` I 'm 60 now , by the time the 30th anniversary comes around I 'll be 70 - I probably wo n't be able to remember what happened , ' the Crystal Palace supporter told Sportsmail .

30	At least 100 families receiving housing benefit are living in luxury homes on handouts that could fund # 1m mortgages , figures have revealed .  More than 30 of those families are being given a staggering # 1,500 a week to live ` swanky ' lifestyles - more than three times the national average wage .  Of the 100 families , 60 have their rent paid by the state to the value of # 5,000 a month , according to the Department for Work and Pensions .  At a time when millions of people are struggling to get on the housing ladder , the handouts would easily cover the monthly payments on a # 1m mortgage .  Luxury : The kind of upmarket homes in Kensington , west London , that the unemployed are being allowed to live in with # 1,500 a week housing benefit handouts  file picture   The trendy white house in Notting Hill asylum seeker Abdi Nur rented with housing benefit . Right , the unemployed Somalian immigrant answers the door in his pyjamas when most people would be at work  Single mother Toorpakai Saiedi who lives in a # 1.2 m House in Acton  The handouts are allowing families to live in upmarket parts of London such as Kensington , Chelsea and Westminster alongside wealthy neighbours such as Roman Abramovich and George Michael .  The figures have been criticised by campaigners and raised concerns that the Government 's plan to cap housing benefit is not being enforced .  Ministers announced last year that housing benefit , which currently costs the taxpayer # 22billion every year , should be capped at # 400 per week .  However , the latest figures from the DWP show there are close to 5,000 families still claiming more than the # 400 cap . Although almost four out of every five people on housing benefit pick up less than # 100 each week .  Public opinion has been riled by the cases of immigrants and asylum seekers who have been allowed to live in lavish flats at the expense of taxpayers .  In 2010 it emerged that a family of Somalian asylum seekers were getting # 1.2 m a year to live in Kensington , West London - a short walk from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge 's new home in Kensington Palace .  Nice wheels ... how did you get them ? Toorpakai 's son Jawad Saindi , 21 , pulls up to the family 's # 1.2 million home in west London  Abdi Nur , 42 , an unemployed bus conductor , his wife Sayruq , 40 , and their seven children moved to the three-storey home in the fashionable area of the capital after complaining that their previous home had been in a ` poor ' part of the city .

The extravagant lifestyle is one that the majority of hard-working families can only dream of .  The figures will raise calls for the Government 's benefit reforms to be bulldozed through the Commons - despite pleading from Liberal Democrats .  The data , made public under the Freedom of Information Act , show the areas of the UK that pay out the most in housing benefit are Birmingham  # 469million per year  , Glasgow  # 337m  , Brent  # 306m  , Westminster  # 281m  , Hackney  # 267m  , Newham  # 264m  , Enfield  # 258m  , Haringey  # 254m  , Liverpool  # 254m  and Manchester  248m  .  Emma Boon of the TaxPayers ' Alliance said : ` This is further evidence that it is right to cap benefits . It is unfair to ask taxpayers to pay for swanky central London homes for others when they ca n't afford to live in those postcodes themselves .  ` Many middle or low income families have to decide if they can afford to house their family in town , or if they have to move out to somewhere more affordable . It is not unreasonable to ask those on benefits to make the same choice . '  The DWP says the new rules which have been put in place mean that those families currently getting more than # 400-per-week will be gradually taken out of the system and moved into cheaper accommodation .

31	By Daniel Mills  The President of the Business Council of Australia , Catherine Livingstone , said some students are better off with a trade  School leavers should consider going into trades rather than university as a deregulated fee system threatens to almost double the cost of a degree .  That 's the view of Business Council of Australia President Catherine Livingstone , who said there are ` too many people ' already enrolled in universities in Australia and more should learn skills for the workforce .  Universities will set their own fees from 2016 , making tertiary education unaffordable for some .  Prof Livingstone said the introduction of deregulated system could see more people undertake vocational education training as they weigh up the benefits and costs of various types of education .  ' I would say there are too many people going to university and not enough going through the VET system , ' Ms Livingstone told the Sydney Morning Herald .  ' I just think some students would be better off with vocation and skill training and having work experience . '  Vocational Education Trade providers such as TAFE could offer substantial benefits to some school leavers  Her comments , made before a Group of Eight universities meeting at the National Press Club last week , come after education experts predicted back in June that the Federal Government 's changes to higher education could force the cost of degrees to increase to more than $ 120,000 .  The high cost of education could deter people from furthering their studies at university and some have predicted loan repayments will almost double from $ 6.6 billion this year to $ 12 billion in 2018 .  The Treasury Department has modeled its own dire forecast for tertiary graduates , claiming that 65,000 people , or 30 per cent of graduates , will be without a job four months after finishing their studies in 2016 .  Group of Eight universities chairman Ian Young told the National Press Club last that many elite universities , such as his own Australian National University , would probably enrol fewer students under a deregulated fee system .  The University of NSW could be one of Australia 's leading institutions which set their own fees from 2016  He added that a decline in enrolments would allow them more personalised learning experience for students at research universities , and would free-up positions for high-achieving students and academics to attend regional and suburban universities .  Australia 's leading research universities typically enrol up to two thirds the number of US universities , because under a capped fee system universities need student numbers to subsidise research programs .  Institutions such as ANU , Sydney and Melbourne , can enrol up to 50,000 students whereas Standford , in the US , enrol just 15,000 .  Education Minister Christopher Pyne has justified fee deregulation by pointing out there will still be benefits to having a degree .  He said graduates will be earning about 75 per cent more than non-graduates - or about $ 1 million more over their lifetimes , but Greens higher education spokeswoman Lee Rhiannon disagrees .  She said : ` It beggars belief the government would introduce these changes when their own department 's figures show fewer graduates will be employed .

33	The warning at railway stations always like to remind us to ` Mind the Gap ' when stepping on or getting off a train .  But perhaps it should also add the words ` particularly if you 're wearing high heels ' , according to research .  An analysis by Network Rail has shown that women in killer heels are particularly in danger of suffering an accident - sometimes fatal - when boarding or getting off a train .  Drinking alcohol beforehand , being in a hurry , carrying luggage or paying more attention to a smart-phone or tablet are the other main risk factors .  Figures show women with luggage and those who have been drinking should take the most care when boarding or getting off a train . File photo  Figures show that , in the last five years , 18 people have been killed and nearly 7,000 injured falling from a mainline station platform while boarding or getting off a train .  Network Rail , together with the Rail Safety Standards Board  RSSB  , is launching a new campaign to improve safety at stations .  The report says 9 per cent of all platform incidents involve ` intoxication ' , noting : ` More men are involved in alcohol related incidents than women . '  But overall women account for 65per cent of accidents alighting or boarding trains .  The report said : ` Footwear could be one reason for this difference . It is also possible that females are more likely to report this type of incident . '  Women aged 50-71 experience the highest proportion of accidents .  One in seven platform accidents involve people struggling with luggage , carrying suitcases , pushchairs , bikes or other baggage .  One in seven platform accidents involve people struggling with luggage , pushchairs , bikes or other baggage  The report also says that getting off the train ` is more hazardous than boarding ' , while summer sees the highest proportion of incident despite having lower passenger numbers .  In the five years between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2014 there were 6,969 reported incidents of slips trips and falls at the point where passengers alight or board trains . This has increased from 1259 in 2009/10 to 1490 in 2013/14 -- an 18 per cent rise .  Clapham Junction in South London has had the highest number of platform incidents  40  followed by St Pancras International  29  , East Croydon  28  , London Victoria  23  London Paddington  22  and London Bridge  22  .  Clapham Junction , pictured , in South London has had the highest number of platform incidents  After that comes Birmingham New Street  21  , Glasgow Central  19  , London Waterloo  18  and Stratford East London  16  .  A public awareness campaign has been launched in stations across Britain called ` Lend a Helping Hand ' . Featuring various pairs of upended feet and legs , it uses cartoons and quirky verse to encourage people to be more considerate of their fellow passengers .  One aimed at drinkers and showing a bottle says : ' If your friends have had a little tipple or had a little fun , Look after them like a good chum . '  Another notes : ' Prams and cases have minds of their own . Oh how they love to speed off alone . '  A third aimed at smart-phone users notes : ` A clever clogs is never clever when glued to the phone . . So keep those eyes peeled for risks that are shown . '  The report notes : ` The gap between the train and the platform is designed to be practical . It must both be large enough to provide sufficient space for a variety of different train types to run safely and practicably without creating a physical obstruction but also be small enough to allow people to get on and off quickly and safely .  ` The gap can not be closed nor can it ever be exactly the same at all Britain 's 2,500 stations , as they were built at different times by different historic railway companies . `    	  Network Rail analysis shows women in killer heels are most in danger    Figures show 18 people have been killed in the last five years and nearly 7,000 injured while boarding or getting off a train	The warning at railway stations always like to remind us to ` Mind the Gap ' when stepping on or getting off a train . But perhaps it should also add the words ` particularly if you 're wearing high heels ' , according to research .	{'rouge2': Score(precision=0.10256410256410256, recall=0.11428571428571428, fmeasure=0.1081081081081081), 'rougeL': Score(precision=0.15, recall=0.16666666666666666, fmeasure=0.15789473684210525)}	Women aged 50-71 experience the highest proportion of accidents .

34	By Alan Roden and Daniel Martin  David Cameron , Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have signed a joint declaration that promises more financial powers for Scotland if it rejects independence .  The move by the leaders of the three main parties is an attempt to rubbish claims by Alex Salmond that Westminster will not deliver more devolution if Scots vote ` no ' .  It comes ahead of tonight 's TV debate between Scottish First Minister Mr Salmond and Alistair Darling , the former Labour Chancellor who fronts the pro-union Better Together campaign .  The three leaders of the main parties - David Cameron , Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband - pictured yesterday at a service to commemorate 100 years since the outbreak of World War One , have signed a joint declaration of more financial powers for Scotland if they reject independence  There are just over six weeks to go until voters in Scotland decide whether to remain in the UK or become an independent nation in the September 18 referendum .  Polls have so far failed to show a majority in favour of independence , but both campaigns are hoping to receive a boost as a result of tonight 's TV debate . The six leaders ' declaration states : ` We support a strong Scottish Parliament in a strong United Kingdom .  ` We now pledge to strengthen further the powers of the Scottish Parliament , in particular in the areas of fiscal responsibility and social security . '  Currently , control over council tax and business rates means the Scottish Government raises about 15 per cent of its # 30billion budget , with the majority of public spending funded by a block grant from the UK Treasury .  The LibDems have the most radical vision for further devolution , proposing to hand over full control of inheritance tax , capital gains tax , income tax and a good share of corporation tax . Holyrood , the Scottish Parliament , would then control 60 per cent of its revenue .  The declaration came as Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond , left , prepared for a TV debate with Alistair Darling , right , who fronts the pro-union Better Together campaign  Labour has proposed increasing the figure to 40 per cent , although experts dispute their calculations . They want members of the Scottish Parliament to have control of a 15p share of the basic 20p rate of income tax , and be able to increase higher bands -- but not lower them unless all levels are reduced .  Tory proposals would allow full control over all rates of income tax , with the block grant from Westminster reduced accordingly .  VAT levels must remain the same under EU rules , but a share of the revenue from Scotland would be controlled by Holyrood .  Scottish MPs would also be allowed to ` supplement ' welfare benefits , while housing benefit could be devolved . If around half of the VAT revenue from Scotland was allocated to Holyrood , the parliament would be responsible for more than 50 per cent of its budget .  Blair McDougall , campaign director for the Better Together campaign , said : ` Voters in Scotland have been listening to the independence debate for over two years now .  Currently , control over council tax and business rates means the Scottish Government raises about 15 per cent of its # 30billion budget  ` Surely if Alex Salmond had convincing answers on the details of separation , we would have heard them by now . '  He added : ` The referendum debate is n't confined to TV studios . It is taking place in conversations between friends and family across Scotland .  ` The biggest debate is taking place on the doorsteps , around kitchen tables and in workplaces across the country .  ` And the more people talk about what leaving the UK would mean for our schools and hospitals , the more they are saying no thanks to separation . '  Yes Scotland chief executive Blair Jenkins said : ` Independence is the opportunity of a lifetime for the people of Scotland .  ` We know Scotland is one of the richest countries in the world , wealthier than the UK , France and Japan , and only the powers offered by a ` yes ' vote will enable us to make this wealth work better for everyone in Scotland .

36	A white TV reporter who was suspended for claiming that an ` anti-cop mentality ' is caused by fatherlessness among young black men appeared on Fox News Wednesday for the first time since his ouster , telling Megyn Kelly that he knew what he was doing when he made his remarks .  Sean Bergin was reprimanded by News 12 New Jersey because he voiced an opinion rather than remained objective after an interview with the widow of a black man who shot dead a rookie Jersey City police officer .  The widow , Angelique Campbell , told Bergin that Lawrence Campbell should have killed more officers , but she later apologized for her statement .  Scroll down for videos  First interview : Ousted News 12 reporter Sean Bergin went on The Kelly File Wednesday to discuss his dismissal over his controversial comments  Accepting responsibility : Bergin , 49 , told Fox News host Megyn Kelly he knew he would be reprimanded for expressing an opinion on air  During his appearance on The Kelly File Wednesday , Bergin shed some light on what preceded the incendiary interview with Angelique Campbell , saying that before News 12 New Jersey aired the segment , the station had been ` besieged ' by phone calls from local police officers asking them not to run it .  According to the veteran reporter , he went to his producer and suggested to shelve the interview with the widow , but since it was a News 12 New Jersey exclusive the station made the decision to air it .  After the interview , Bergin concluded his Sunday night report by saying that the underlying cause of an anti-police mentality is young black men growing up without fathers .  He said : ` It 's important to shine a light on this anti-cop mentality that has so contaminated America 's inner cities , ' Bergin said . ` The underlying cause of all of this , of course , young black men growing up without fathers . '  Speaking to Miss Kelly on Fox News , Bergin explained that his goal was to provide some balance and context - but he was well aware of the risks .  ` There 's no doubt that I went off the reservation , ' he said . ' I made a couple of rogue remarks at the end ... I knew what I was doing . '  He added : ` I knew there would be some consequences ; I knew there would be some ramifications . I thought maybe I would get a reprimand , maybe a temporary suspension ... '  Ousted : Sean Bergin , a reporter with News 12 New Jersey , has been suspended for voicing his opinions about black families and relations with police and wo n't be back on air  Bergin , a contracted employee , said the station told him that his assignments would be cut to one a week and he declined to remain in the position .  The ousted reporter has reiterated that he decided to address the subject of young black men in the context of the officer 's killing because he wanted to send a message .  ` This has got to stop . Somebody has to have the guts to stand up and point at this and say , `` Hey man , we got ta start talking about this . ''  ` I know it 's a touchy subject , I know it 's a sensitive issue ... there is shame involved here . Nobody wants to be known as the man who abandons his children . '  The National Association of Black Journalists ' president , Bob Butler , challenged Bergin 's connection between young black men growing up without fathers and anti-police sentiments and said that Bergin went beyond the standards of a news reporter by inserting his views on the story .  ` Are there problems in the inner city with kids without fathers ? Yes . But does that make kids violent ? No , ' Butler said . ` There are a lot of kids without fathers who go to college , graduate and become upstanding citizens .  ` He 's talking about a social phenomenon where there 's lack of opportunity in communities . '  But Bergin brushed off Butler 's criticism , insisting there there is a clear link between fatherlessness and the negative sentiment many black youths have towards police .  ` I think you can certainly draw a connection between fatherless young men and this feeling of anti-authoritarianism , ' he told Kelly .  Asked about the message his ouster from News 12 sends , Bergin responded : ` Do n't speak out . Just stay silent . it 's safer that way . You 'll keep your job . '  When asked if he would have been demoted had he spoken out in support of gay marriage , Bergin replied that it is a question he wishes his former news director would answer .  Kelly later posted a message on Bergin 's Facebook page , writing that she had asked Dr Ben Carson , a frequent Fox News contributor , about the reporter 's suspension .  ` Dr. Carson 's response : `` Pretty soon people will be afraid to express themselves about anything , ''' she wrote .  In an interview with the Associated Press Tuesday , Bergin sounded a defiant note , saying : ` If I had it to do over again , I would do the exact same thing .  ' I broke the rules . I knew I was breaking the rules . But sometimes you have to break the rules to do the right thing . '  He said that the issue of young black men without fathers deserves more media coverage .

News 12 New Jersey viewers have been leaving messages on Bergin 's ` wall ' thanking him for taking a stand on a controversial issue .  A Facebook page created in support of the ousted journalist has drawn nearly 3,200 ` likes ' as of Wednesday night .  Sean 's sister , Trish Bergin Weichbrodt , wrote online that a veterans ' motorcycle group and several police organizations are holding a rally in support of her brother Thursday outside the studios of New 12 Long Island in Woodbury .  The TV station said that the response to Bergin 's report was being handled internally and that it does n't comment on personnel matters .  ` It is News 12 's policy that reporters must be objective and not state personal opinions on-air , ' the station said in a statement Tuesday .  The National Association of Black Journalists ' president , Bob Butler , challenged Bergin 's connection between young black men growing up without fathers and anti-police sentiments and said that Bergin went beyond the standards of a news reporter by inserting his views on the story .  ` Are there problems in the inner city with kids without fathers ?

37	Support : Sarah Palin last night said that if she lived in South Carolina she would vote for Newt Gingrich as Republican presidential candidate  Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin threw her support behind presidential candidate Newt Gingrich last night .  But she drew short of backing him , saying that if she lived in South Carolina she would vote for Gingrich to prevent Mitt Romney becoming the Republican nominee .  Palin said she wants to see the Republican primary continue .  Should frontrunner Romney win Saturday 's primary vote in South Carolina then he will stand against President Barack Obama for election later this year .  At this stage , Palin said she wants to keep the Republican nomination open as the GOP candidates are improving as the contest continues .  She told Fox News : ` If I were a South Carolinian ... I would want to see this thing continue because iron sharpens iron , steel sharpens steel . These guys are getting better in their debates .  ` If I had to vote in South Carolina , in order to keep this thing going , I 'd vote for Newt . And I would want things to continue . More debates , more vetting of candidates . '  Palin , the Republican vice presidential candidate in 2008 , considered entering the presidential race last year but ultimately decided not to . She still holds sway among tea party activists .  As Saturday 's South Carolina primary vote approaches , Gingrich yesterday levelled a forceful new attack on Romney , calling the frontrunner 's former private equity firm ` exploitive ' .  Gingrich had attacked Bain Capital before , but his comments before a gathering of business leaders in Columbia contained some of his harshest rhetoric yet .  After lagging behind in the Iowa causes and the New Hampshire primary , Gingrich is hoping a strong showing in the nation 's first Southern primary will re-energise his White House bid .  Scroll down for video  Campaign trail : Newt Gingrich speaks in Columbia , South Carolina , yesterday . Palin drew short of backing Gingrich , but said she would vote for him to prevent Mitt Romney becoming the Republican nominee  Where eagle dares : Gingrich speaks to supporters alongside his wife Callista at the Art Trails Gallery in Florence , South Carolina , yesterday  As Saturday 's South Carolina showdown approaches , a poll yesterday showed that Mitt Romney now enjoys the backing of 37 per cent of Republicans across the U.S. .  The Gallup poll followed Monday night 's hotly contested GOP presidential candidate debate in Myrtle Beach .  Romney 's nearest rivals , Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum , both polled at 14 per cent each .  He held little back in his criticism of Romney , saying that , in at least some instances , the Bain model has meant ` leverage the game , borrow the money , leave the debt behind and walk off with all the profits .  ` Now , I 'll let you decide if that 's really good capitalism . I think it 's exploitive . I think it 's not defensible . '  Gingrich continued that what Romney engaged in ` is not venture capital ' .  ` Venture capital is when you go in and put in your capital and you stick it out , ' he said .  Gingrich has faced rebuke in some quarters as attacking the GOP bedrock of free enterprise in his criticism of Romney and Bain .

He said : ` I 'm proud of real capitalists . I 'm proud of guys who say to their workers I 'm in it with you . If I lose money and you lose a job we lost together because we both tried . '  Earlier in the day , Gingrich said at a town hall meeting in West Columbia that a Muslim-American seeking office in the U.S. would have to publicly renounce Islamic law to receive his backing .  When asked if he could support a Muslim for office , the former House speaker replied that it ` would depend entirely on whether the person would commit in public to give up sharia , ' or Islamic law .  Gingrich said he is totally opposed to Islamic law and supports a federal law that would pre-empt it .  ' A truly modern person who worshipped Allah would not be a threat , ' he said .

The Prime Minister is poised to extend a referendum on the issue to 16 and 17-year-old Scots as a concession to Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond at a meeting on Monday .  But a former Tory Scottish secretary said the precedent would make it ` impossible ' to prevent youngsters voting in future general elections , and ` bring politics into our schools ' .

He said : ` Once that has happened it will be impossible to argue that 16-year-olds should not have the vote in all elections . You ca n't pick and choose .  ` If you are going to make this step , which is a huge step . . . then a Bill should be brought before the House of Commons and people will then have an opportunity to consider the arguments properly and make amendments .

We 've been campaigning for a very long time to lower the voting age to 16 and this is a very exciting opportunity that 's being presented in Scotland to demonstrate that when you do give the vote to 16-year-olds , the sky does n't fall in .

The idea was last proposed in 1999 and was defeated by a majority of more than 400 . However , it is the official policy of the Liberal Democrats and is supported by Labour leader Ed Miliband .  Lord Forsyth said : ` What is happening here is that Alex Salmond is attempting to bully the Prime Minister into agreeing to having 16-year-olds voting in the Scottish referendum in return for having a single question on independence .  ` The referendum will be towards the end of 2014 .

41	Steven Gerrard had just given one of his finest Liverpool performances when he was asked a question that stopped him in his tracks .  Having scored two goals to inspire a 4-0 demolition of Real Madrid in the Champions League , Steven was soaking up the atmosphere inside Anfield when Raul , the legendary Spain striker and emblem of Madrid , came up to him . He congratulated him and then got straight to the point .  ` Will you come and join us next season , Steven ? ' asked Raul .  VIDEO Scroll down to watch funny Steven Gerrard impressionist and Rodgers praising him  Staying put : Steven Gerrard has been at Liverpool for the whole of his career  Holy grail : Could Gerrard lift the Premier League trophy this season ?  That offer , which was made five years ago this week , was not the first he received to leave Liverpool , nor was it the last , but it illustrated how the powerhouse clubs in Europe viewed him - a big-game player who produced the big moments exactly when they were needed .  Of course , there was never any chance of Stevie going to Madrid , but had he done so it would have been impossible to begrudge him the opportunity .  Those with his quality deserve to perform on the biggest stage and deserve to have trophy cabinets that are full to the brim . Had he chosen to leave , he could have doubled his collection of 11 major honours . If , say , he had joined Chelsea when the chance first arose in 2004 -- the same year Manchester United tentatively enquired about him -- Stevie would have lifted the Barclays Premier League trophy three times .  My only advice to him back then , when Chelsea ramped up their efforts , was to look at the big picture . He could have gone to Stamford Bridge and returned with all kinds of medals but when he eventually returned home to Liverpool , how would he have been viewed ?  Would Liverpool fans have congratulated him ? Would they have been happy to see him be successful ? Given the rivalry between the clubs , it would have been impossible . That 's why one title with Liverpool would mean more to him than 10 anywhere else .  Ultimately , he was right to stay ; 12 months after that first offer from Chelsea , Stevie got his hands on the biggest prize of all in Istanbul . He immortalised himself with his performances that season , most notably in the Champions League final against AC Milan .  No go : Gerrard was asked by Raul when he was going to join the Spanish giants  It could have been so different : Chelsea made a move for Gerrard but he opted to stay at Liverpool  Tittle winner : Gerrard could have won the Premier League title if he had moved to Chelsea  When you think about it , though , his loyalty to Liverpool has been unbelievable . Had he not come from this city , I do n't think for one moment he would have stayed , particularly given that Liverpool have n't been anywhere near the Champions League for five years .  I do n't believe he needs the medal to cement his legacy but if you are a genuine football fan , for everything he has done over the past 15 years , you should want to see him complete his collection .  There are parallels with his current situation to how it was for Bryan Robson at United in the early 1990s , a club captain who had enjoyed great success , led his country with distinction but had found the one honour he craved most of all frustratingly out of reach .  Robson was still United 's driving force when they mounted their first real assault on the title in 1991-92 , but their quest to end a 25-year wait was shattered at Anfield when Liverpool won 2-0 . Stevie could easily find himself in a similar position on Sunday .  If Chelsea beat Aston Villa and Liverpool lose at Old Trafford , I feel a 10-point gap would be too difficult to overhaul , but Stevie is going into this make-or-break collision playing some of the best football of his career .  He has been questioned at times this season and there was even a theory Liverpool would be better off without him after they blitzed Tottenham 5-0 in December , but such talk about a man who has scored in each of the four major cup finals and at two World Cups was nonsense .  Without any kind of fuss , he has slotted into what has been called ` the Pirlo role ' and dictated Liverpool 's play , showing his exemplary range of passing . It is the latest role he has mastered . He is a player who grandfathers will tell their grandchildren about .  We love foreign players who can star in a variety of positions . We hear about how they have been well-schooled but what about Stevie ? He has thrived as a No 10 , a deep-lying central midfielder , on the right flank or at right back . He could even play as a central defender and do n't forget Fabio Capello used him on the left for England .  Landing the big one : Gerrard 's won the Champions League with Liverpool in 2005  Here to stay : Gerrard speaks with then Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez after committing his future to the club in 2005 following interest from Chelsea  Silver lining : Gerrard has won every domestic trophy in his time at Anfield - except the Premier League  There has been talk he will end his international career after the World Cup but he is still England 's first-choice midfielder and I ca n't see anyone emerging to dislodge him .  Jack Wilshere and Jordan Henderson are the new kids on the block but they are still playing catch-up . Leading England to Brazil is something I know he is very proud of , but nothing would make him prouder than leading Liverpool to a first title since 1990 .  Full steam ahead : Gerrard will lead England in Brazil  The next generation : Jordan Henderson and Jack Wilshere could be the future of England 's midfield  After the Rafa Benitez era was over , we both felt our chance to become champions of England had gone . Certainly when Brendan Rodgers became manager , that feeling was even more acute as we knew it was a new project that would take a while to get going , so to be in this position is not something Stevie is going to want to let slip .  Captain Marvel : Bryan Robson went years at United without winning the league title  Job done : Robson finally got his hands on the Premier League title in 1993  Followers of Chelsea and Manchester City will disagree -- so , too , will Manchester United fans and Evertonians -- but there would be no more romantic end to this season than seeing Stevie lift the Premier League trophy at Anfield on May 11 .  For his quality and loyalty , it would cap a glorious career .  It was a privilege to be in the Nou Camp on Wednesday to see the exhilarating battle between Lionel Messi and Vincent Kompany .  Earlier this season , after his colossal display against Manchester United , I said Kompany had given one of the best performances I 'd seen by a central defender , and had City managed to get through to the last eight , I would have said the same again .  Star turn : Lionel Messi played a big part in Barcelona beating Manchester City on Wednesday  Dink of delight : Messi scores at the Nou Camp against City  To see him playing with such power , presence and understanding , it reminded me of Marcel Desailly at his best . He was like a man playing against boys . His signing for # 6million in 2008 must rate as City 's best value-for-money signing of their modern era .  But it has to be noted that Kompany was marking a Messi who was only playing at 70-80 per cent of his maximum . You could see him walking around for long periods , protecting himself so he did n't suffer any further hamstring problems .  Marked man : Vincent Kompany gets to grips with Messi  Dejected : Kompany reacts after his team 's defeat in Barcelona  When Messi came alive , though , he was a joy to watch . He was always aware of what was going on around him and he produced six or seven pieces of play that took the breath away . When he got the chance to finish the tie , there was never a sense he would miss .  We must all hope that Messi does not get plagued by hamstring trouble because he could light up the World Cup this summer . If he produces in Brazil what we have seen him do for Barcelona , Argentina will have an outstanding chance of winning their first title since 1986 . What 's more , if Messi peaks in June and July , we 'll be talking about the greatest player of all time .  A fortnight has flown by since my last column and once again I 've had plenty of things to keep me busy .  1 Dinner with Roy Hodgson - It was good to catch up with my old manager in Barcelona . He 'd been to watch Manchester City 's Champions League game and , after I 'd finished my duties with Sky , we had a bite to eat . He is relishing going to the World Cup .  Good catch up : Jamie Carragher went for dinner with his former manager Roy Hodgson in Barcelona  2 Watching some authentic football - Marine , who play in the Evo-Stik Northern Premier League , are based not too far from where I live and last weekend I took my son , James , to see them play Ashton United . Marine lost 1-0 but it was an enjoyable game and we will go again .  3 Starting a new playing CAREER - It was good to be involved in the ` Game against Poverty ' with a host of stars 10 days ago in Switzerland but earlier this week I stepped on to the five-a-side court for the first time . It certainly got the old legs moving !  Star turnout : Carragher joined Ronaldo , Luis Figo , Zinedine Zidane and a many more stars in the Match against Poverty  4 Tuning into the Six Nations - I 've become more interested in rugby union since my visit to Twickenham last month and the action this afternoon promises to be riveting . Fingers crossed England get the convincing win they need to become champions .  Final chance : Stuart Lancaster and England go into their final game with Italy with a chance of winning the Six Nations  5 Waiting for the Great Escape - I will be at Old Trafford to see if Manchester United can retrieve a difficult situation against Olympiacos and that will evoke some memories . Liverpool , of course , needed a dramatic victory against the Greek side on the way to the Champions League final in 2005 . Can United do the same ?  You beauty : Gerrard celebrates scoring for Liverpool against Olympiacos in 2004 to earn a 3-1 win  	  Liverpool man has had plenty of chances to leave Anfield but stayed loyal    Gerrard could end England career this summer - but who will replace him ?

42	As the death toll from Ebola reaches 3,800 , experts are warning that the virus could mutate and become airborne , meaning that it could be caught by breathing it in .  The public is being told by health officials that the virus that causes Ebola can not be transmitted through the air and can only be spread through direct contact with bodily fluids -- blood , sweat , vomit , feces , urine , saliva or semen -- of an infected person who is showing symptoms .  However , several leading Ebola researchers claim that the virus mutating and spreading through the air should not be ruled out .  As the death toll from Ebola reaches 3,800 , experts are warning that the virus could mutate and become airborne  Virus expert Charles L. Bailey , who in 1989 helped the American government tackle an outbreak of Ebola among rhesus monkeys being used for research , told the LA Times : ` We know for a fact that the virus occurs in sputum and no one has ever done a study -LSB- disproving that -RSB- coughing or sneezing is a viable means of transmitting .  ` Unqualified assurances that Ebola is not spread through the air are `` misleading '' . '  Dr C J Peters , who has undertaken research into Ebola for America 's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , told the paper : ` We just do n't have the data to exclude it -LSB- becoming airborne -RSB- . '  Meanwhile virologist Dr Philip K Russell , a former head of the U.S Army 's Medical Research and Development Command , told the paper : ' I see the reasons to dampen down public fears . But scientifically , we 're in the middle of the first experiment of multiple , serial passages of Ebola virus in man ... . God knows what this virus is going to look like . I do n't . '  In September , Michael Osterholm , the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota , writing in the New York Times , said experts who believe that Ebola could become airborne are loathed to discuss their concerns in public , for fear of whipping up hysteria .  Discussing the possible future course of the current outbreak , he said : ` The second possibility is one that virologists are loath to discuss openly but are definitely considering in private : that an Ebola virus could mutate to become transmissible through the air . '  The public is being told by health officials that the virus that causes Ebola can not be transmitted through the air and can only be spread through direct contact with bodily fluids  Dr Osterholm warns viruses similar to Ebola are notorious for replicating and reinventing themselves .  It means the virus that first broke out in Guinea in February may be very different to the one now invading other parts of West Africa .  Pointing to the example of the H1N1 influenza virus that saw bird flu sweep the globe in 2009 , Dr Osterholm said : ` If certain mutations occurred , it would mean that just breathing would put one at risk of contracting Ebola . '  Dr Osterholm said public health officials , while discussing the possibility in private , are reluctant to air their concerns .  Virus expert Charles L. Bailey said unqualified assurances that Ebola is not spread through the air are ` misleading '  ` They do n't want to be accused of screaming `` Fire ! '' in a crowded theater - as I 'm sure some will accuse me of doing .  ` But the risk is real , and until we consider it , the world will not be prepared to do what is necessary to end the epidemic . '  He called for the United Nations to mobilise medical , public health and humanitarian aid to ` smother the epidemic ' .  The chair of the UK 's Health Protection Agency , Professor David Heymann of the London School of Hygiene of Tropical Medicine , said it is impossible to predict how any virus will mutate .  He said scientists across the world do not know enough about genetics to be able to say how the Ebola virus will change over time .  He told MailOnline : ` No one can predict what will happen with the mutation of the virus . I would like to see the evidence that this could become a respiratory virus . '  The first person diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. died on Wednesday despite intense but delayed treatment , and the government announced it was expanding airport examinations to guard against the spread of the deadly disease .  The checks will include taking the temperatures of hundreds of travelers arriving from West Africa at five major American airports .  The new screenings will begin Saturday at New York 's JFK International Airport and then expand to Washington Dulles and the international airports in Atlanta , Chicago and Newark . An estimated 150 people per day will be checked , using high-tech thermometers that do n't touch the skin .  The White House said the fever checks would reach more than 9 of 10 travelers to the U.S. from the three heaviest-hit countries - Liberia , Sierra Leone and Guinea .  President Barack Obama called the measures ` really just belt and suspenders ' to support protections already in place . Border Patrol agents now look for people who are obviously ill , as do flight crews , and in those cases the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is notified .  As of Wednesday , Ebola has killed about 3,800 people in West Africa and infected at least 8,000 , according to the World Health Organization .  A medical official with the U.N. Mission in Liberia who tested positive for Ebola arrived in the German city of Leipzig on Thursday to be treated at a local clinic with specialist facilities , authorities said .  The unidentified medic infected in Liberia is the second member of the U.N. mission , known as UNMIL , to contract the virus . The first died on September 25 . He is the third Ebola patient to arrive in Germany for treatment .  The virus has taken an especially devastating toll on health care workers , sickening or killing more than 370 of them in the hardest-hit countries of Liberia , Guinea and Sierra Leone - places that already were short on doctors and nurses .  There are no approved medications for Ebola , so doctors have tried experimental treatments in some cases , including drugs and blood transfusions from others who have recovered from Ebola .  The survivor 's blood could carry antibodies for the disease that will help a patient fight off the virus .      	  Public is being told that Ebola can only be transmitted by direct contact    Experts warn that the possibility it could become airborne ca n't be ruled out    ` Assurances Ebola is not spread through the air are misleading ' - expert    Ebola has killed about 3,800 people in West Africa and infected at least 8,000	As the death toll from Ebola reaches 3,800 , experts are warning that the virus could mutate and become airborne , meaning that it could be caught by breathing it in .

Then a surfer , who had been enjoying the waves , leapt into the sea and battled the strong pull of the current to reach the couple 's 14-year-old son and plucked him out of the 5ft swell .  The father , meanwhile , had been sucked several hundreds yards into the sea where he managed to push one of his girls , aged 16 , on to rocks in the hope she would be able to cling on .

Aidan McSweeney , 18 , sustained multiple injuries when he fell from the rooftop after taking drug mephedrone .  The clever teenager had recently moved out of the family village home in Towcester , Northamptonshire , after his A-levels to live with friends in town .  His distraught mother Lynne Bucinikas , 54 , described her son as a ` sensitive ' boy who became a victim of peer pressure .  Away from home he lived in an environment where drugs like mephedrone were readily available which he took to ` fit in ' .  Lynne , who runs a landscape gardening business , yesterday sent a stark warning to other parents .  She said : ` I think it 's appalling that so many youngsters died before it was made illegal . Even now you can find it and other manufactured drugs like it online .  ` It 's become socially acceptable to take at parties and I want parents to realise how freely available these drugs are to young people .  ` My son was a sensitive and intelligent boy but he wanted to fit in , you would n't realise the danger if everyone is doing it .  ` He moved out to live with his friends . We live in a quiet village so it allowed him to go out , I was happy for him to enjoy himself .  ` I think he took the drugs to feel accepted by his peers , he always wanted to be the entertainer at parties .  ` Before he died we heard that he had not slept for three days on this drug . We were told that other times he woke up in unfamiliar places with no idea how he got there . '  Aidan moved out of his family home in Towcester , which he shared with his mother and sister Catlin , 17 , to a flat in Northampton .  Grieving family : Lynne Bucinkas and her 17 year old daughter Caitlyn from Paulerspury , near Northampton , say Aidan became the victim of peer pressure  He had finished his A-Levels and was deciding whether to take a year out or accept his place at Coventry University to read politics .  Aidan died in hospital just eight hours after he plunged to the pavement near his flat at 2.25 am , on July 19 , last year .  He had climbed up onto scaffolding and fell from the roof in what Lynne believes was a drug-fuelled prank .  Traces of mephedrone , which was made illegal just three months earlier in April 2010 , were found in his system .  The heartbroken mother spoke out after a coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death at his inquest at Northampton Coroners Court .  Lynne blasted a young man who was known to hold drug fuelled parties at the time of her son 's death and was later convicted of dealing .  She said : ` We know that Aidan was seen going to this dealers house about four hours before he died but he denied selling Aidan drugs .  ` He was the same age as Aidan and held parties for youngsters where drugs were available .  ` He made so much money from selling to impressionable kids . He avoided police detection because he was n't your typical drug dealer .  ` He was geeky looking , from an affluent family and drove a nice car .  ` Aidan saw this dealer as a friend but he was just an evil predator who got kids hooked on drugs .  ` We know Aidan took mephedrone before his death and I am convinced that if he had n't he would be here now .

46	By Neil Sears  Last updated at 3:13 PM on 14th September 2011  With her fuller figure , bags under the eyes and unkempt hair , Dawn Dunbar is not your archetypal high class prostitute .  Yet according to the 37-year-old , she was able to charge an astonishing # 20,000 a week for her sexual services .  She made the claim to a judge yesterday as she tried desperately to hang on to hundreds of thousands of pounds given to her by a client who had stolen the money .  Confiscation order : Self-confessed prostitute Dawn Dunbar at her Oxfordshire home yesterday  However , after looking at her in court , Judge Stephen John took a different view on her worth -- and ruled that while # 2,000 might be a fair price for seven days of sex , # 20,000 was completely over the top .  The figure is important because it has been argued that if the cash she was given was for payment for services , she could not be compelled to give it back . If , however , it was a gift , she could .  Self-confessed prostitute Miss Dunbar received # 1.75 million from Paul Hopes , an accounts manager for the Toys R Us shop chain . In just 18 months he stole # 3.7 million from the toy firm , and was only caught when neighbours of Miss Dunbar alerted police to her lavish lifestyle , fearing she was a drug dealer .  Judge John said : ` The amount is not # 500 a week . It is not # 1,000 , or even # 2,000 a week . It is # 20,000 a week . How do you manage to evaluate your services -- sex -- at # 20,000 a week ? How do you justify that ? '  Miss Dunbar , who also received a # 132,000 Bentley from Hopes , said : ` It was n't me that was putting the worth on that . It was Mr Hopes paying what he thought it was worth . '  Married father-of-two Hopes , 60 , was on a salary of # 56,000 a year when he suddenly developed an unquenchable thirst for vice and began his massive fraud .  Paul Hopes , left , admitted 14 counts of theft and four of money laundering - but spent none of his ill-gotten gains on wife Gillian , right  He spent little on his oblivious wife Gillian , or their home in Woodley , Berkshire , but used the cash to pay for sex and gifts for Miss Dunbar and four other prostitutes . On occasions he enjoyed # 800-a-time cocaine binges while visiting luxury hotels and restaurants with them .  Hopes was duly divorced by his wife , who retained the # 400,000 family home . He was jailed for seven years in 2009 , and warned he could stay in prison for an extra decade if he failed to repay the stolen money .  At Reading Crown Court , Judge John ruled that the sums given to Dunbar were gifts rather than payment for services and she would have to hand the loot back . That is , the money she has left after spending # 750,000 of it on a # 300,000 house and cars .  Miss Dunbar , a married mother of two , of Didcot , Oxfordshire , was earning barely # 10,000 a year at a bookmakers when she turned to earning extra money by working at the Gemini massage parlour in Reading in 2005 .  On her very first day she met Hopes . He swiftly arranged to pay her a weekly fee of # 500 for her services , before persuading her to leave the business and see him exclusively , for a weekly fee of # 1,000 . That continued with him also giving her additional payments and making extravagant gestures .  Double life : Hopes ' former home in Woodley , Berkshire , which has now been given to his wife in a divorce settlement  And when she told him ` Every girl wants a Bentley ' , he promptly bought her one -- a Continental Flying Spur .  Miss Dunbar told the court : ` Everything I received was a payment for my escort services and for him to see me exclusively . ' She was not his lover , she went on , and was simply providing sexual services in return for payment .  Miss Dunbar said : ` He said I was his mistress , which I was , but in a specific meaning -- he would call me his mistress if he wanted me to whip him and treat him quite badly . '  Judge John ruled the receivers appointed to chase the missing cash could seize a # 25,000 Lexus GS300 Miss Dunbar bought for her father , a # 30,000 Toyota Landcruiser she bought for her husband Martin Iheanacho , and her own runabout , a # 42,000 Lexus RS400h 4x4 car .  The enforcement team will also go after properties she bought , both in the UK and a # 60,000 plot of land in her husband 's native Nigeria.Approached at her house , Miss Dunbar said : ` I 'm in shock , ' before slamming the door .  Another hearing into # 600,000 Hopes handed over to prostitute Tanya Wieck is due in coming weeks .

Van Gaal has been forced into calling on the services of inexperienced defenders such as Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair in the absence of his first choice defenders .  The 63-year-old has also had to deploy the likes of Michael Carrick , Antonio Valencia and Blind out of position to fill in for his wounded stars .

53	By Meghan Keneally  PUBLISHED :  17:34 EST , 15 October 2013   |  UPDATED :  17:37 EST , 15 October 2013  Hillary Clinton has taken a jab at Vice President Joe Biden by questioning his support for the Osama bin Laden raid .  The dig marks an important line of offense for Clinton as Biden would be her strongest competition if they both decide to run as the next Democratic nominee for president in 2016 .  At a conference in Atlanta on Tuesday , the former Secretary of State told a version of events where she was in favor of giving the Navy SEAL mission the go-ahead to kill the terrorist but Biden was more uncertain .  Competitors : Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden  Seen here together in 2011  are widely considered the most likely candidates for the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016  Clinton spoke at the National Association of Convenience Stores and a politician in the audience told the local paper about what she said .  ' I know she 's running for president now , because toward the end , she was asked about the Osama bin Laden raid . She took 25 minutes to answer , ' state representative Tom Taylor told the Atlanta Journal Constitution .  ` Without turning the knife too deeply , she put it to  Vice President Joe  Biden . '  No press was allowed inside the event , but Taylor reported that she portrayed herself as being one of the strongest supporters of the raid - alongside then-CIA director Leon Panetta .  In the room : Clinton said that she was in support of the May 2011 raid while Biden was more cautious and concerned  By contrast , she mentioned that Biden was against the raid multiple times during the speech .  The success of the raid is a significant and Clinton knows it : Bill Clinton even talked about Obama 's decision to give the raid the go-ahead during a campaign TV spot during the 2012 re-election .  Neither Clinton nor Biden have officially announced that they 're running to take over the White House after President Obama 's second term ends in 2016 , but their actions have been speaking for them .  Clinton has made a number of speeches at conferences after taking a break from the public eye following the end of her term as a cabinet member in January .  Picking sides ? Many read into President Obama 's decision to be interviewed for the first time after being re-elected alongside Clinton instead of Biden  Publicly supportive : Vice President Biden spoke at the Clinton Global Initiative conference late last month , as the event is run by his possible rival and her husband  As she was leaving office , she sat down for a televised interview along with President Obama , and that was viewed in political circles as a silent endorsement by her former competitor as he chose to have Clinton in that interview and not his vice president .  Biden has been doing his own campaigning , however , as he attended a function in the crucial primary battleground state of Iowa last month .  Even still , that might not be enough as three of President Obama 's top aides have all publicly stated that they think the Democratic nomination belongs to Clinton .  ' I think that Hillary Clinton probably will be the candidate . If she does n't run , I think Biden will run , ' former senior White House advisor David Axelrod said in a June interview according to Politico .

It has a simple premise : press the Stream button , point the phone 's camera at a scene and a link to stream is automatically tweeted from a connected account .  There is also a Schedule button to start recording at a later time .  This tweet is posted with a -LSB- LIVE NOW -RSB- message . An optional #meerkat tag is added to the end of the tweet to make it easy to find .  That user 's followers can reply and retweet the link , to get more people involved , and watch it through the app or on a desktop browser .  So far , streams have included US chat show host Jimmy Fallon rehearsing a monologue for The Tonight Show and live streams of sports . Other more mundane , and in some cases disgusting , streams have included people riding on a bus or even picking their nose  Notably , some of these sports streams have been live from the event while others have simply been a live stream of the sport on the user 's TV . This means that people who ca n't afford a cable TV subscription could watch a game online . The top searches on Twitter include #meerkat and #meerkat live sports  shown   So far , streams have included US chat show host Jimmy Fallon rehearsing a monologue for The Tonight Show , Spotify streaming a live spin class with DJ and live streams of sports .  When Meerkat first launched last month it imported a user 's Twitter followers as well as showed who they were following .  However , this was said to have annoyed Twitter and the social network cut off Meerkat 's access to this service .  Twitter recently bought a live-streaming service called Periscope which is a direct rival to Meerkat .  Meerkat has found a way around this though by adding a search feature that lets users find their favourite Twitter users .  Notably , some of these sports streams have been live from the event while others have simply been a live stream of the sport on the user 's TV .  This means that people who ca n't afford a cable TV subscription , for instance , could watch a game through someone 's Twitter feed .  The top searches on Twitter include and #meerkat , #meerkat live sports .  It is unclear how this would affect licensing and broadcasting laws and MailOnline has asked a lawyer and broadcasters for comment .  Sky told MailOnline that it : ` focuses on preserving the value of its investment in sports broadcasting rights and , as part of this , will monitor new technologies and digital distribution methods that become available .  ` We work closely with our rights holder partners to , where appropriate , address unauthorised use .

The app promotes itself as a tool for citizen journalists to broadcast live footage of news events , for example . This cuts out the need to film a video and upload it to YouTube , for example .  Mr Rubin told Business Insider his favourite use of the app was live BBC reporting from protests in Ferguson .  There is no limit on the length of stream but once the stream has ended it is automatically removed from Meerkat 's servers - similar to jhow Snapchat works .

But people could use screen capturing software during the stream if they wanted to record and keep it .

There is also the wider issue of hacking . If a hacker was able to take control of a user 's phone and camera they could use the service to live stream any footage they wanted .  Of course , this is an issue that affects a wide range of apps , and not just Meerkat , but its immediacy and live nature highlights the problem more than on other services .

'  Irsay acknowledged in 2002 that he had become dependent on painkillers after several years of orthopedic operations but said he had overcome the problem after undergoing treatment .  Marion County prosecutors said the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration investigated how Irsay obtained the painkillers . Federal authorities would n't confirm any investigation was taking place . Prosecutors at the time said they saw no reason to charge Irsay .  A plastic surgeon who wrote painkiller prescriptions for Irsay later surrendered his federal permit to prescribe narcotic drugs .

56	By Rob Cooper  PUBLISHED :  06:35 EST , 29 November 2013   |  UPDATED :  08:01 EST , 29 November 2013  ` Suing God ' : Rev Mark Sharpe , 47 , who has been given permission to take legal action against the church after he was ` hounded out of his parish '  A village vicar who says he was bullied by parishioners for four years and forced out of his job has won permission to ` sue God ' .  Reverend Mark Sharpe , 47 , claims his dog was poisoned , his telephone lines were cut and his tyres slashed because he was considered an ` outsider ' .  The vicar , who likened local residents to characters out of the League of Gentleman , accused the church of failing to support him in the remote country parish in Teme Valley South , near Tenbury Wells , Worcestershire .  In a move reminiscent of the Billy Connolly film ` The Man Who Sued God ' , Rev Sharpe tried to sue for constructive dismissal .  He was refused permission to take legal action against the church when a tribunal judge upheld centuries old ecclesiastical laws which say the clergy are not employees but office holders ` employed by God . '  But the decision was overturned yesterday by a judge yesterday at the Employment Appeal Tribunal in London - paving the way for Rev Sharpe to sue the church .  The vicar claims that animal excrement was smeared on his car , glass was smashed on the driveway , heating oil was stolen and he was threatened on the doorstep of the rectory by a parishioner .  He says he was forced to install CCTV cameras at the rectory with his wife Sara after being constantly plagued by prowlers following their move with their four children in 2005 .  One church warden even objected to Rev Sharpe 's beard , warning him that locals wanted a ` clean shaven clergyman ' , he claimed .  He took sick leave in April 2006 , which continued until he resigned in 2009 and he is not currently working.The former Royal Navy chaplain - who once successfully sued the Ministry of Defence after just 24 days at sea - is now taking action against the Bishop and Diocese of Worcester .  The reverend joined the priesthood when he left his former job as a police dog handler in 2001 . His next role was with the Royal Navy as a chaplain but he quit and later won a sexual harassment tribunal .  In that case he said he was forced to turn a blind eye to widespread use of porn and was awarded a five-figure pay-out .  Rev Sharpe , who is being supported by the faith workers section of the Unite union , claims he was effectively forced out of his parish and that the bishop and diocese of Worcester did nothing to protect him .  Legal action : Rev Sharpe is pictured here with his wife Sara and children Naomi  right  , Lydia  left  and Thomas  second from the right  outside his home in the parish . He took sick leave in 2006 before resigning in 2009  Parish : Teme Valley South All Saints Church in Hanley Broadheath , Worcestershire , where Rev Sharpe was the vicar until he was ` hounded out by parishioners '  The church initially admitted in 2008 that Rev Sharpe was a worker entitled to bring a claim , but changed their mind in 2012 and asked for permission to withdraw that concession .  Judge Alan McGarry ruled in favour of the church at an employment tribunal in Birmingham .  However that ruling was overturned by Mrs Justice Cox on appeal and the case will now have to be reheard by the lower tribunal , if a settlement is not reached first .  Speaking after his victory , Rev Sharpe said : ` This decision has come as an immense relief . I never intended to set out on this journey , but I was forced down this route in order to seek recompense for my family and I.  Legal action : Rev Sharpe was initially refused permission to sue the church - but that decision has been overturned on appeal  ' I feel vindicated by the stand that Unite has taken on my behalf and hope to move to a swift resolution of the outstanding issues with the church , so that I can move forward to the next chapter of my life . '  Unite national officer Rachael Maskell said : ` This is a very welcome decision that vindicates Mark 's brave stand over the last eight years , not only in ministering to his parish , but fighting for compensation after he unfairly lost his job . '  A spokesperson for the Church of England said : ` In the light of the Supreme Court decision in relation to Ministers in the Methodist church , the judge has decided not to uphold the original judgement .  ` She has ruled that the case should be reconsidered by the Employment Tribunal , in accordance with the legal principles as set out in her judgement .

57	Pilot Jan Cocheret wrote at the beginning of the year about his fear of being locked out of the cockpit after visiting the aircraft 's toilet  A Dutch pilot ` predicted ' the Germanwings crash several weeks ago in an article written in a specialist flight magazine posing the question : ' I seriously wonder who 's sitting next to me . '  Chillingly Jan Cocheret , who flies a Boeing 777 for Emirates airlines warned : ' I hope I never find myself in the situation where I go to the toilet and return to find a cockpit door that wo n't open . '  Mr Cocheret was writing for Dutch flying magazine Piloot en Vliegtuig  Pilot and Plane  where he expressed his fears .  His article warned that someone could use the security procedures introduced in the aftermath of the 9/11 atrocities to prevent an aircraft 's captain re-entering the flight deck after a rest break .  French prosecutors have determined that Andreas Lubitz waited for his captain to leave the flight deck before disabiling key pad controlling access to the cockpit .  He then selected an altitude of 96 feet on the aircraft 's flight computer before setting it on its collision course with the Alps .  Investigators revealed that the aircraft 's captain Patrick Sondenheimer can be heard banging on the cockpit door urging his colleague to open up until the jet hits the Alps at more than 400 miles per hour .  Audio leading up to the crash revealed that Captain Sondenheimer had complained that he did not have enough time to use the toilet while the aircraft was on the ground in Barcelona . As soon as the aircraft achieved its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet , Captain Sondenheimer can be heard leaving the cockpit .  As soon as the door closed behind him , Lubitz flicked a switch which disabled the keypad on the cabin side of the door for five minutes and initiated his descent .  The door lock override is switched off after five minutes as an additional safety measure in case the flight crew become incapacitated . Lubitz is believed to have flicked the switch a second time during the eight-minute descent .  Mr Cocheret later wrote on his Facebook page : ` Unfortuantely , this terrible scenario has become a reality . '  Scroll down for video  Andreas Lubitz locked his captain out of the cockpit before commanding the aircraft to crash into a mountain  Scientists are currently trying to identify the remains of the 150 people killed in the disaster using DNA  Investigators are currently trying to carve a road up to the crash site to help speed up the recovery process  His original article predicted the exact way such an atrocity could be carried out .  He said : ' I seriously sometimes wonder who 's sitting next to me in the cockpit . How can I be sure that I can trust him ? Perhaps something terrible has just happened in his life and he 's unable to overcome it .  ` There indeed does exist a way to get back into the cockpit , but if the person inside disables this option  the security code to get in  , one could do nothing but sit with the passengers and wait and see what happens . '  German airline Lufthansa has set aside $ 300 million to deal with potential civil claims against the company following the Germanwings disaster .  The French crash investigators BEA said they will look into methods of preventing a similar incident in future .  A spokesperson said : '  We will study  systemic weaknesses  that  might possibly have led to this aviation disaster . '  German officials have revealed that Lubitz , 27 , received psychotherapy before gaining his pilot 's licence after expressing suicidal tendencies .  Crash investigators are trying to build a road to the site of the crash to help speed up recovery efforts and attempts to find the second black box .  Lufthansa has so far refused to say whether they were aware of Lubitz 's mental health history although they said he had passed all the required medical tests to work with Germanwings , its low-cost subsidiary .

58	Busted : Ana Gloria Garcia-Gutierrez , 53 , was arrested by Pinellas County Sheriff 's deputies early Saturday morning for riding a manatee in September  A Florida woman who had made headlines around the world after being photographed riding a manatee was arrested Saturday and charged with a misdemeanor under the state 's protection act .  Ana Gloria Garcia Gutierrez , 53 , was taken into custody at the Sears store at Tyrone Square Mall in St. Petersburg where she works .  Her arrest comes more than a month after she came forward to admit that she was the woman seen in pictures on the back of a manatee , or sea cow , in Fort DeSoto Park in Pinellas September 30 , NBC reported .  The photos were posted online October 2 and went viral . Sheriff Bob Gualtieri held a press conference a few days later asking for the public 's help in identifying the woman riding the endangered animal .  ` Go ride a Jet Ski , ' the sheriff said at the time . ` Do n't use animals . '  Gutierrez called deputies later that day and allegedly admitted touching the sea mammal . She told them she was new to the area and did n't know her actions were against the law . The manatee was not hurt .  Florida 's Manatee Sanctuary Acts reads : ` It is unlawful for any person at any time , by any means , or in any manner intentionally or negligently to annoy , molest , harass , or disturb or attempt to molest , harass , or disturb any manatee . '  The case was forwarded to the State Attorney 's Office for prosecution .  if convicted of the second-degree misdemeanor , Gutierrez faces up to 60 days in jail and a $ 500 fine . She was released on $ 1,500 bail , according to Tampa Bay Times .  Molestation : Police are on the hunt for the woman , pictured , who was snapped riding a manatee on Sunday  On September 30 , Pinellas County Sheriff 's deputies rushed to the beach at about 1pm after receiving reports of a woman ` riding ' the animal . But when they arrived , the culprit had disappeared .  However , a quick-thinking onlooker managed to take photographs of the woman 's joy ride .  After the photos of a woman dressed in a black and white bikini top , red boardshorts and a white cap straddling a manatee were released by the Pinellas County Sheriff 's Department , the 53-year-old Gutierrez turned herself in .  She reportedly claimed that she was new in town and did not know she had done anything wrong .  Florida 's Manatee Sanctuary Act forbids ` activities may not , either intentionally or negligently , molest , harass , collide with , injure or harm manatees . '  On the run : When Pinellas County Sheriff 's deputies arrived at the scene , the woman , pictured , had disappeared  Illegal : Under Florida law , it is illegal to ` annoy , molest , harass , or disturb or attempt to molest , harass , or disturb any manatee '  Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said the manatee-molestation was ` outrageous ' and warned people to leave the animals alone .  ` This is manatee mating season and there are a lot of manatees around but people need to just leave them alone and not molest them and certainly not try to ride them , ' he said during a news conference .  ` It 's pretty outrageous when somebody does that . '  But the sheriff 's office told the Orlando Sun-Sentinel that she was not arrested because the crime did not take place in a deputy 's presence .  Deputies told the paper that charges would be referred to the Florida State Attorney 's Office .

61	The father of British-born ` cop killer ' Alexandria Hollinghurst had a violent showdown with her boyfriend just hours before the couple took off on a rampage that ended with a police officer gunned down and the teens dead in an apparent suicide pact .  In an exclusive interview with MailOnline , 17-year-old Alex 's grandfather , David Hollinghurst , has revealed his son Tom 's desperate last-ditch bid to put an end to 18-year-old Brandon Goode 's relationship with his daughter .  He has told how the family had watched in despair as his ` beautiful granddaughter ' went off the rails -- stealing , ` vanishing off ' and getting into drugs .  Heartbroken : David Victor Hollinghurst , grandfather of Alexandria Hollinghurst , pictured on his front porch at his home in Okeechobee , Florida  Final encounter : Mr Hollinghurst revealed to MailOnline that his son had a violent confrontation with Brandon Goode , 18  right  , before the teen and Alex Hollinghurst  left  ran off and gunned down a police officer  And he has exposed a fantastical plot hatched by the teens to steal a boat , sail it to Panama and live on a beach .  Speaking from his home in Okeechobee , Florida , Mr Hollinghurst , 61 , said : ` Alex had vanished off in the night late on Wednesday and on Thursday Tom went round to Goode 's mother 's house and found Brandon there .  Victim : Windermere , Fla. , Police Department Officer Robert German was shot and killed early March 22 , 2014 , after stopping Alex and Brandon and calling for help in an Orlando suburb  ` He told me he yelled at him so all the neighbors could hear . He said he was going to have him charged with statutory rape if he came near his daughter again .  ` Goode wanted Tom to punch him so that he could report him for assault but Tom did n't . '  MailOnline first told how Hollinghurst had been reported missing by her mother , Debra , on Thursday , March 20 , only to return when the police officer responding to the call was out interviewing her in the family home .  But Mr Hollinghurst claimed : ` She came back but only so she could take what she could before running off with him again . '  According to Mr Hollinghurst , his granddaughter stole a computer , jewelry and ` anything else she could sell , ' before disappearing one final time some time during the night .  He tearfully recalled : ` She 'd been acting stupid like that for a while , vanishing off and coming back . '  Mr Hollinghurst , a former truck driver from Manchester who moved to the States in 1995 , explained that he initially assumed this time would be no different .  But he said : ` Tom phoned me on Saturday night at 7pm . He said , `` They found her dad . ''` I said , `` Where is she ? ''  Off the rails : The 61-year-old grandfather detailed how his beautiful , intelligent granddaughter started stealing and turned to drugs  Happier times : Tom Hollinghurst , Alex and Debra in Blackpool , UK  ` He just said , `` She f *** ing dead . '' I just shouted , `` No ! '''  The teenage lovers ' bodies were found in the Orlando suburb of Windemere 100 yards from where officer Robert German was shot in the head .  They apparently killed the 31-year-old cop after he stopped them during a routine foot patrol through the neighborhood Saturday morning .  Mr Hollinghurst described the days since that awful moment as ` one terrible time warp . It 's like one long day . It never ends . '  Asked whether he believed his granddaughter had taken her own life or was killed by her boyfriend , Mr Hollinghurst admitted he no longer knew what Alex was capable of .  He said : ` They found out that the pair of them had planned to go down to Clearwater and steal a boat then sail it to Panama and live on a beach somewhere .  ` I do n't know what she was capable of . I do n't know what he was capable of . '  Using her wiles : Alex 's grandfather said the teen  right  was very pretty and knew she could use her charms to get whatever she wanted from her father  Lovers ' plot : Alex  left  and her boyfriend allegedly planned to steal a boat , sail it to Panama and live on a beach  Living in fear : Mr Hollinghurst expected his granddaughter 's boyfriend to show up at his house and kill him  When he heard his granddaughter was missing , he admitted , he half expected her to turn up at his home and feared her boyfriend would kill him .  He knew that her parents had struggled to control her in recent months .  He said : ` She was such a beautiful little girl , the cutest thing and she knew it . She was always pretty and she could get whatever she wanted from her dad .  ` But she 'd started stealing . She 'd started with the drugs . She was so bright , so beautiful . She could have been anything . '  Apple of dad 's eye : Alex 's father , Tom Hollinghurst , was devoted to his daughter and nicknamed her ` Stick ' because of her thin build  Mr Hollinghurst said that while Alex 's relationship with her mother was strained , Tom , 42 , was ` devoted ' to the daughter he nicknamed ` Stick ' because of her slender frame and she to him .  He said : ` Tom loved his girls -- Debra and Hannah and Alex. He adopted Georgia the oldest , Debra had her already .  ` He called them his ` girly gang . ' They could get him to do anything . '  He said that Alex was ` good as gold ' until last fall when she began getting into trouble .  He said : ` She disappeared off with her boyfriend just before Christmas and had only showed up at home again recently .  ` She wrecked her car in January -- she just was n't looking left or right , just careless . She was stealing from the shoe shop where she worked . '  Shaking his head , he reflected how different the troubled teen of recent months was from the 11-year-old who came to America with her parents in 2007 .  The family initially lived with Mr Hollinghurst and his late wife , Lynett , who died from breast cancer two years ago .  He recalled how Alex had settled into the local school before the family moved to Davenport a two-hour drive away .  The last time Alex visited her grandfather was , he said , just before Christmas 2011 .  Her grandmother , who died at age 57 , was desperately ill and she , sister Hannah and father Tom helped put up the tree and care for her .  Reckless : Alexandria crashed her car in January because her grandfather said she was careless  Sticky fingers : Mr Hollinghurst said after running away from home , the 17-year-old  right  briefly returned to steal a computer and jewelry  Mr Hollinghurst said : ` Alex was so good with Lynett . She could n't really talk , the cancer had gone to her brain and Alex devised a sort of chart so she could point to things , tell us what she wanted and it worked for a while . '  Now , he and the rest of his family are left struggling to understand how it all went so wrong , so quickly .  The Medical Examiner has yet to conclude his report and the cause of death is still pending .  Alex 's parents maintain she was killed by Goode and had not intended to take her own life . Whatever the truth , Mr Hollinghurst said he plans to leave America in the wake of the tragedy .  He said : ` I arrived here in 1995 with $ 300 and a job in Alabama but I do n't want to be here now . The whole American dream 's over for me now .

62	Biologists have proved that the gecko 's ability to climb and hang from slippery surfaces is effortless . A Tokay gecko is pictured  You may think Spiderman 's ability to scale vertical walls is pretty neat , but the superheroes abilities are nothing compared to a gecko 's .  After years of wondering whether the lizards have to exert energy to stick to walls , biologists have proved their talent is effortless .  Researchers found that the adhesive power comes purely from the adhesive toe pads on the underside of gecko feet .  And they came to this conclusion by sticking dead geckos to slippery surfaces .  The lizards , which are found in places with warm climates , can cling to even shiny vertical surfaces with the most remarkable strength .  The tests were carried out by biologists at the University of California , Riverside .  ` With regards to geckos , being sticky does n't require effort , ' Timothy Higham , an assistant professor of biology at the university said .  Together with William Stewart , a postdoctoral researcher in his lab , Assistant Professor Higham found that ` dead geckos maintain the ability to adhere with the same force as living animals , eliminating the idea that strong adhesion requires active control . '  ` Death affects neither the motion nor the posture of clinging gecko feet .  ` We found no difference in the adhesive force or the motion of clinging digits between our before - and after-death experiments . '  For years , it has been presumed that the ability to stick to surfaces has required muscle activity instigated by a gecko to push its foot and toes onto a surface to enhance adhesion .  Researchers proved the sticking power simply comes from the adhesive toe pads  pictured  on the underside of gecko feet , by proving that even dead geckos can stick to walls . For years , it was presumed the ability required muscle activity instigated by a gecko to push its foot and toes onto a surface to enhance adhesion  Geckos climb on a wide variety of surfaces , including smooth surfaces such as glass .  They have adhesive pressures of 15 to 30 pounds  6.8 kg to 13.6 kg  per square inch for each limb , meaning a gecko can hang its entire body by one toe .  A gecko 's toe consists of a microscopic hierarchical structure of stalk-like setae - 100 microns in length , 2 microns in radius .  From individual setae , a bundle of hundreds of terminal tips called spatulae - approximately 200 nanometers in diameter at their widest - branch out and contact the climbing surface .  These hairs create an electrostatic force known as Van der Waals .  It causes neighbouring molecules to be attracted to each other .  Although very weak , the effect is multiplied by thousands of tiny hairs that cover a gecko 's toes , allowing them to stick firmly to surfaces .  To test the well-held belief , the biologists used a device involving a controlled pulling system .  This device applied increasing pulling forces to a gecko foot and measured ` clings ' by pulling it in a controlled manner along a vertical acrylic sheet .  It also recorded adhesion with video cameras .  The experiments showed that the adhesive force , or motion , of a gecko foot when pulled along a vertical surface was similarly high and variable when the gecko was alive and immediately - within 30 minutes - after death .  Geckos can climb a variety of surfaces , including smooth glass .  Their sticky toes have even inspired climbing devices , such as so-called Spider-Man gloves .  The toe pads on the underside of gecko feet contain tiny hair-like structures called setae , which stick to surfaces through frictional forces as well as forces between molecules , called van der Waals .  These tiny structures are so strong that the setae on a single foot can support 20 times the gecko 's body weight .  The controlled experiments are the first to show that dead animals maintain the ability to adhere with the same force as living animals .  The results refute the notion that actions by a living gecko , such as muscle recruitment or neural activity , are required for gecko feet to generate forces .  ` With regards to geckos , being sticky does n't require effort , ' Timothy Higham , an assistant professor of biology at the university said . A live Tokay gecko is shown  ` The idea that adhesion can be entirely passive could apply to many different kinds of adhesion , Professor Higham said .  ` This is clearly a cost-effective way of remaining stationary in a habitat . For example , geckos could perch on a smooth vertical surface and sleep for the night - or day - without using any energy . '  The new work suggests that the ` active ' component of gecko adhesion is actually a reduction of adhesion force when the gecko lifts its feet by curling up the tips of the digits , while the rest of the foot remains on the surface .  Dr Stewart explained : ` We found that the dead animals were more likely to experience damage to their adhesive system , which suggests that the active control may actually prevent injury .  ` In other words , when the forces become too high , the gecko likely releases the system using its muscles . '  The study , which was published in the journal Biology Letters , may now be used to develop new robots .  A climbing system inspired by geckos has turned Spider-Man fiction into fact by making it possible for a human to scale vertical glass .  During tests , an 11-stone  70kg  volunteer crawled up a 12ft  3.6 metre  pane using just sticky attachments on his hands and feet .  The gadgets employ the same natural molecular forces that allow gecko lizards to scurry around on ceilings .

Although very weak , the effect is multiplied by thousands of tiny hairs that cover a gecko 's toes , allowing them to stick firmly to surfaces .  Scientists created tiny tiles called ` microwedges ' to generate Van der Waals forces and produce a dry adhesive even more efficient than the gecko 's .  During the experiment , the volunteer testing these microwedge attachments simply peeled them on and off the glass .  The US team led by Dr Elliot Hawkes , from Stanford University , wrote in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface : ` Using this system , a human of mass 70 kilograms  11 stone  successfully ascended a 3.6-metre  11 ft  vertical glass wall with 140 square centimetres of gecko-inspired dry adhesives in each hand .  ` The synthetic adhesion system creates a nearly uniform load distribution across the whole adhesive area , improving upon the adhesive-bearing structures of a gecko 's toe and enabling a human to climb vertical glass using an area of adhesive no larger than the area of a human hand .

Scroll down for video  Mummy 's boy : Pictured when he was younger , Irfan Naseer was branded a class joker - but years later plotted evil attacks on the UK  But behind his fanaticism , his own mother called him a ` mummy 's boy ' and his school friends branded him a ` joker ' and ` idiot ' as he tried to entertain them in the playground by rapping .  Nicknamed ` Chubbs ' at school , one ex-classmate , told The Daily Mirror : ` He used to write his own rap music and perform it to us . It had us in stitches . He was the class idiot . '  Another former friend told the Daily Mirror : ` In about 2008 or 2009 he cut all ties with his old school friends .  Irfan Naseer , nicknamed ` Chubbs ' began plotting bombing attacks across the UK  ` Never in a million years did we think he could be responsible for such an evil plan . '  He was one of the ` four lions ' gang and it was bulky frame that helped him to work on his bomb-making skills while at training camps in Pakistan .  He was too overweight to go on physical training exercises , and admitted he was mixing chemicals rather than ` running up and down the mountains with weapons ' .  Naseer gained an A at A Level chemistry , and honed his skills during a four year pharmaceuticals course at Aston University in Birmingham , coming out with a 2:2 degree in 2003 .  He barely worked afterwards and spent his time showing his fellow terrorists how to make a bomb out of sports injury treatments .  His fascination for science first began during experiments at school while studying for GCSE chemistry classes , when the teacher showed him how to distil chemicals with a Bunsen burner .  ` When I was doing my GCSEs , one of the teachers did an experiment where he had a Bunsen burner and he threw a chemical on to the fire ' , he told the court .  ` It caused a massive flame which blackened the roof , and that kind of got me into it . '  After a raid on the group 's headquarters in Birmingham , Naseer had chemistry textbooks left over from his university days on his book shelves in his bedroom , mixed in with a Jihadi flag and terrorist handbooks .  Ashik Ali and Irfan Khalid were found guilty of planning a string of bombings that prosecutors said could have been deadlier than the July 7 attacks in London  He had also searched repeatedly online for bomb making tips and details of how to concoct homemade explosives .  Among his Internet search history was a website containing the Anarchist 's Cookbook .  Big Irfan admitted in court he had spent eight-and-a-half years memorising the Koran , from the age of 19 .  He wanted to treat himself to a quad bike in the run up to his martyrdom and was overheard telling his fellow plotters : ` It 's good fun , yeah , but I would n't do it on the road - that 's not befitting , bro .  Irfan Khalid and Irfan Naseer  right  were ` central figures ' in a terrorist bomb plot they planned to inflict across the UK  The trio funded the plot by pretending to be Muslim Aid charity street collectors  It was Naseer 's bulky frame that helped him to work on his bomb-making skills while at training camps in Pakistan  Charity funded terror : The men posed as fundraisers for a Muslim charity  left  then used the cash to pay for bomb devices such as this alarm clock  right   ' A guy with a beard and that sitting on top of that does n't look good . '  Irfan Naseer , 31 , Irfan Khalid , 27 , and Ashik Ali , 27 , all from Birmingham , were convicted on Thursday of plotting the ` spectacular campaign ' designed to claim as many lives as the 2005 London Underground bombs that killed 52 innocent people  The trio , who met at school and called themselves the Four Lions after the black comedy film by Chris Morris , even funded the plot by pretending to be Muslim Aid charity street collectors .  Police received no intelligence from the Muslim community in Birmingham about the terror cell , even after relatives of four of the gang discovered they had travelled to Pakistan .  The only time police were contacted about any of them was over an allegation of aggressive fundraising , concerning their charity street collections .  The lack of information raises questions over Prevent , the Home Office 's strategy to combat violent extremism , which has police community engagement at its core .  Detective Inspector Adam Gough , senior investigating officer in the West Midlands Counter-Terrorism Unit , said the extended families of Ishaaq Hussain , Shahid Khan , Khobaib Hussain and Naweed Ali ` became aware ' the men had gone to a terror training camp when Khan called home .  Although the families immediately pressured them into returning , none contacted police .  Police and security services were aware the four were travelling , and they had been recorded talking about getting their families into paradise through their martyrdom .  But officers decided against stopping them at that time to preserve the surveillance operation .  According to detectives , none of the men received any terror training as they left the camps after a day .  Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale said that while the ` ideal ' scenario would have been for the relatives to inform police of what had happened , the families had ` tried to do their best to bring them back and stop them from getting into harm ' .

66	Musician-come-author Daryl Davis has revealed how he came to embed himself with members of the Ku Klux Klan .  The 54-year-old lecturer became fascinated with racism in the United States as a child living overseas .  With parents in the foreign service , he was raised in integrated schools all over the world and was used to multiculturalism .  ` Every time I would come back  to the US ,  I would see people separated by race , ' he explains in a new interview with The Guardian Express .  ` When my father was telling me about  the KKK  at the age of 10 it did n't make any sense to me .  ' I had always gotten along with everyone . '  Pioneer : Daryl Davis plays the blues at the 17th annual Bluebird Blues Festival . Davis has been lauded for his work in breaking down divides between black people the Ku Klux Klan  In 1983 Davis - who is friends with Jerry Lee Lewis and has performed for Bill Clinton - was playing country western music in an all-white lounge .  Following his set , a man approached him praising his music , saying it was the first time he had heard a black man play as well as Lewis .  The two sat down to talk and the man told Davis he was in the KKK .  ` At first , I thought ` why the hell am I sitting with him ? ' Davis said .  ` But we struck up a friendship and it was music that brought us together , ' he says .  Little did Davis know at the time , this man would be the key to his future endeavors .  Eight ears later Davis decided to write a book examining the Ku Klux Klan and managed to track his friend down .  ' I went to his apartment unannounced , ' Davis says .  ` He opens the door and sees me , and he says '' Daryl ! What are you doing here ? ''  ` He stepped out of his apartment and I stepped in .  He said ` what 's going on man ? Are you still playing ? '  ' I said ` I need to talk to you about the Klan ' . '  At first the man refused to cooperate , saying it would put Davis in danger , but eventually he handed over the information of Roger Kelly , who was the leader of the KKK in Maryland .  The man warned Davis to meet Kelly in a public place out of safety .  Davis had his secretary set up a meeting , instructing her to not tell Kelly he was black .  ' I knew enough about the mentality of the Klan that they would never think a white woman would work for a black man , ' he said .  Daryl Davis has explained how he began befriending members of the KKK , which eventually lead to the dismantlement of some factions and at least 20 members dis-robing and leaving the Hooded Order  The pair met a hotel , with the secretary fetching an ice bucket with sodas .  The meeting was ` fraught with tension from the start ' after Kelly arrived with a nighthawk - an armed bodyguard dressed in military fatigues .  ' I saw the apprehension  when Kelly realized I 'm black  so I got up and walked over and said '' Hi Mr. Kelly , come on in '' .  ` He shook my hand , the bodyguard shook my hand , and they came in . Mr. Kelly sits down and the bodyguard stands at his right .  ` He asked for identification and I handed him my drivers ' license .  He says '' oh you live on Flack Street in Silver Spring ' ' .  ` Well , I did n't need him coming to my house and burning a cross or whatever , and here he is calling off my street address .  ' I wanted to let him know not to come to my house so I said ` yes , and you live at ... ' and I said his street address .  ' I made it clear - ' let 's confine our visit to this hotel room . '  ` But I had no reason to be concerned . One of his Klan members lived right down the street from me . It was coincidence . '  The interview began and each time Davis reached into his bag to get a new cassette for his voice recorder , the bodyguard would reach for his gun .  Davis said the man relaxed ` after a little while ' .  But that 's when the trouble started .  ` After about an hour , there was a very loud , strange noise which was ominous , and I was apprehensive .  ` In the back of my mind , I heard my friend in my head saying '' Mr. Kelly will kill you '' .  ' I stood up and slammed my hands on the table , and I felt my life was in danger .  ` When my hands hit the table , my eyes locked with his , and he could read them . We stared into each others eyes .  ` The bodyguard was looking back and forth at us , but then my secretary Mary realized what had happened .  ` The ice bucket had melted and the cans of soda shifted , and that 's what made the noise !  ` We all began laughing at how stupid we all had been .  ` In retrospect , it was a very important lesson that was taught .  ` All because a foreign entity of which we were ignorant , entered into our comfort zone , we became fearful of each other .  ` The lesson learned is : ignorance breeds fear . If you do n't keep that fear in check , that fear will breed hatred .  ` If you do n't keep hatred in check it will breed destruction . '  The situation made way for a friendship with Kelly , which lead Kelly to start relationships with about 20 other KKK members .  He has collected about that many robes and hoods that were given to him by members who left the Klan after meeting him .  Davis is credited with dismantling the Maryland KKK because the group 's structure ` fell apart ' after he began making inroads with the men .  Davis said he would simply challenge the many misconceptions Klansmen had about black people as a result of brainwashing .  In one circumstance , a member told him that ` all black people had a gene that makes them violent ' .  He countered by saying that ` all white people have a gene that makes them serial killers .  ` He said '' that 's stupid '' and I said it 's just as stupid as what you said to me . He was very quiet after that and I know it was sinking in , ' Davis said .  Davis also became close with Robert White , a leader in the KKK known as a Grand Dragon .  ' I respect someone 's right to air their views whether they are wrong or right , ' Davis said .  ` Robert White was a Grand Dragon who had gone to prison numerous times .  ' I said I wanted to interview him for my book .  ` At first , he was very violent and very hateful but we talked for a long time .  ` Over time , he began thinking about a lot of things he had done and said that were wrong .  ` He quit the Klan .  ` Toward the end he said he would follow me to hell and back ... and he gave me his robe and hood . '  All these relationships and experiences have been documented in Davis ' book , Klan-Destine Relationships , in which he concludes that the best way to break down barriers and improve race relations is for people who disagree to sit down and talk .  ` Invite your enemy to talk - give them a platform to talk because then they will reciprocate , ' he said .  ` Invite your enemies to sit down and join you .  ` One small thing you say might give them food for though , and you will learn .  ` Establish dialogue . It 's when the talking stops that the ground becomes fertile for fighting .  ` When two enemies are talking , they 're not fighting .

67	By Sean Poulter  PUBLISHED :  16:42 EST , 10 October 2012   |  UPDATED :  02:20 EST , 11 October 2012  Fruit and vegetable prices have soared by 50 per cent plus in the past year after the wettest summer in a century devastated crops .  A snapshot survey of fresh produce costs reveals some startling increases , and supermarkets are warning of more to come .  Grain prices are also surging because harvests both in the UK and abroad have been hit , which will put up the cost of bread and pasta .  Expensive : Fruit and veg prices have doubled in the past year after the wet summer ruined crops  It has already led to dramatic increases in the cost of animal feed and this will have a knock-on effect on the price of milk , chicken , eggs , pork and bacon .  The survey by the shopping and price comparison website MySupermarket.co.uk found that at Asda a 2.5 kg pack of Maris Piper Potatoes has doubled in price from # 1 to # 2 since October 2011 , while a pack of British Gala apples is up 70 per cent to # 1.70 .  At Tesco , a kilo of loose carrots is up 50 per cent to 90p , while a 400g pack of cauliflower and broccoli florets is up 25 per cent to # 1.25 .  Sainsbury 's has put up the price of its Conference pears by 39 per cent to around 39p each , while its loose Royal Gala apples are 19 per cent more .  The Essentials range at Waitrose is designed for shoppers on a budget , but a 1kg pack of carrots is up 55 per cent in a year to 90p , while pointed spring cabbage has risen by 35 per cent to 80p .  The price increases mean that many people are not buying the fresh produce they need for a healthy diet  The price rises mean many people are not buying the fresh produce they need for a healthy diet .  The poorest 10 per cent of households are buying 25 per cent less fruit than in 2007 , while their vegetable consumption has fallen by 15 per cent , according to a study published by the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs.Tim Lang , professor of food policy at London 's City University , said the surge in the price of fresh produce is ` a disaster for public health ' .  The British Retail Consortium , which speaks for the major supermarkets , insists its members are protecting customers against the worst effect of rising prices .  Its food director , Andrew Opie , said : ` Retailers are doing a lot to keep fruit and veg affordable , from running record numbers of promotions to putting more produce into their basic ranges . '  But bosses at Tesco and Sainsbury 's have warned of shortages of home-produced fruit and vegetables and higher prices in the run-up to Christmas .  The problems for British farmers relate to the torrential rain during the summer months and more recently , which have left many fields waterlogged .  The national potato harvest could be the lowest in 35 years , while the apple crop is down by around 25 per cent .  Farmers are also highlighting the fact that Britain 's wheat harvest has fallen by around 15 per cent this year on the five-year average , with productivity down to 1980s levels .  While the problem in the UK has been too much rain , in the US and Russia droughts have hit wheat , soya , corn and other grains , pushing up the price of animal feed .  Poor harvests will affect the price of animal feed , which will push up the cost of meat  The National Farmers ' Union has suggested that some members will pull out of chicken and pig production because the rise in feed costs mean they can not make it pay .  Its president , Peter Kendall , said : ` It 's been soul-destroying for the farmers growing the crops . '  He added : ` The challenge for the pig and poultry market is to make sure retailers pay a fair price , because in pigs 50 per cent of the cost is grain , poultry it 's 60 per cent .  ` These farmers at the moment , because the prices have n't responded yet , they 're saying I 'm not going to fill my sheds with poultry or pigs any more . '  The extent of the washout is starkly illustrated by the decision of one of England 's leading wine producers to abandon its harvest .  The wettest summer in England and Wales for 100 years means that for the first time since it planted its first vines in 1988 , Nyetimber has decided its grapes are not worth collecting .  Sussex-based Nyetimber , which makes wines , has decided its grapes are n't worth collecting  Sparkling wines made by Nyetimber , which is based at West Chiltington in West Sussex , are popular with the Royal Family .  The 2007 Classic Cuvee was the only sparkling wine served on the Royal Barge during the Diamond Jubilee pageant on the Thames and was also served at the Diamond Jubilee lunch at Westminster Hall .  Winemaker Cherie Spriggs said : ` My first obligation is to ensure the quality of Nyetimber 's wines , and we have decided that the grapes from 2012 can not deliver the standards we have achieved in the past and will again in the future .

Tang Ge , 38 , of Irlam , Greater Manchester , had met the unidentified woman after putting an advert on an online community forum looking for someone to do domestic chores , police said .  She took a coffee from him not realising he had secretly slipped a sleeping pill into it , before he clinked his cup against hers and told her : ` drink your coffee , it 's getting cold ' and ` bottoms up ' .  The woman began to feel faint before Ge slipped tablets into a glass of water . He was heard stirring it with a spoon before he suggested she drink that too , Manchester Crown Court was told .  The student woke up in bed 10 hours later with some of her clothing removed but no memory of what happened . Tests revealed she was raped .  Ge - who translated Mandarin at police stations , detention centres and courts - was today starting a nine-year prison term after being convicted of rape and perverting the course of justice .  The incident occurred in September 2009 after Ge - also known as ` Tony ' - had befriended the foreign student via the advert he placed a few weeks before , Manchester Crown Court heard .  Ge turned up at her home at lunchtime and asked if he could come in to eat some food he had bought from a cafe . She let him in and was given the takeaway coffee he had also just bought .  Hearing : The incident occurred in September 2009 , Manchester Crown Court  pictured  was told  The woman started to feel dizzy so Ge went to get her a glass of water . She heard the sound of him stirring the glass and when he returned she saw that it was cloudy .  Mugshot : Ge used to translate Mandarin at police stations , detention centres and courts  She pretended to drink the water before hiding it , but then passed out . She later woke up and called police . Forensic officers arrived and recovered items including the glass of water .  Two days later Ge was arrested and interviewed . Forensic analysis of the victim 's blood revealed traces of Temazepam and Oxazepam , both of which are sedatives .  The cloudy liquid in the glass from the victim 's home was found to contain Temazepam . Forensic tests also confirmed Ge had raped her .  In February 2012 , Ge stood trial but a jury failed to reach a verdict after he insisted the woman was lying .  Police probed some of his defence evidence and discovered it had been deliberately falsified .  His medical records revealed that he had been prescribed the sedatives used in the attack . He was convicted following a retrial .  Detective Constable Dave Ogden of Greater Manchester Police said today : ` Once Ge had gained the confidence and trust of the victim he wormed his way into her flat where he drugged and raped her .  ` The victim only started to piece together her awful ordeal when she regained consciousness some nine or 10 hours later . I can not even begin to imagine the horror she experienced when she realised that she had been raped by Ge .  ` To make matters worse he has failed to acknowledge what he has done throughout , trying to make the victim out to be a liar and forcing her to sit through two trials .  ` I am pleased he has been exposed as the conniving and dangerous sex offender he is and I hope the victim can feel some sense of justice now he has been jailed .

71	Los Angeles residents have their claws out against Department of Water and Power after one of its workers rescued a cat from atop a utility pole , only to drop it from above his bucket truck .  KTLA reported that residents called the Los Angeles Fire Department and LADWP to remove the cat , which had been lying on top of a utility pole in the suburb of Sunland .  According to an onlooker , a worker sent by LADWP donned gloves and went up in using his truck 's extending bucket to pluck the cat from the pole .  Scroll down for video  Tossed : The utility worker rescued the cat from the pole before dropping him towards a lawn next to the bucket truck  One witness , Mark , described the worker as being ` gentle ' during the rescue , saying ` He coaxed it over to him . He got it in the bucket . He started coming back down . '  ` He stopped about halfway , ' said Mark , before taking the cat out of the bucket and dangling it over the edge .  In video of the rescue , the worker can be heard telling a woman standing under the pole to get out of the way before tossing the cat towards the grass .  The woman is heard screaming before attempting to catch the cat with a green blanket while it zips away into a nearby yard .  The utility worker apologized to the crowd , saying ` Sorry , he was really clawing me up there . '  ' I realize he 's not a professional cat rescuer , and I thank him for doing the job , ' Gail , another onlooker told KTLA .  Rescue : The utility worker was described as ` gentle ' when he went up in the bucket to try and coax the cat down  ` For the future it would be great if he could do something , or other people could learn , that if they 're going to do a cat rescue , to try to come to the ground level . '  ` The bottom line is that the cat was rescued , ' LADWP spokesperson Michelle Figueroa told the Los Angeles Times . ` Staff risked electrocution to save the cat .

72	By Jessica Satherley  UPDATED :  16:14 EST , 24 November 2011  An influential Iran parliamentarian has claimed that the country has arrested 12 CIA agents .  Parviz Sorouri , who sits on the powerful committee of foreign policy and national security , said agents had been operating with Israel 's Mossad as well as other regional agencies , and targeted the country 's military and its nuclear programme .  ` The U.S. and Zionist regime 's espionage apparatuses were trying to damage Iran both from inside and outside with a heavy blow , using regional intelligence services , ' he was quoted as having said yesterday .  ` Fortunately , with swift reaction by the Iranian intelligence department , the actions failed to bear fruit . ' He did not specify the nationality of the alleged agents , nor when or where they had been arrested .  Concern has been growing in both Israel and the U.S. at the prospect of a nuclear Iran and Tel Aviv has long warned it might carry out a military strike on Iran 's nuclear programme .  Spying : The discovery damages U.S. attempts to track the activities of Iran and its president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , right , and Hezbollah 's Sheik Hassan Nasrallah  A UN report earlier this month claimed the country was on the verge of building an atomic which prompted a strident response from Iran 's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that the country would not retreat ` one iota ' from its nuclear programme .  Hezbollah and Iran are among the CIA 's toughest adversaries and have been improving their ability to hunt spies by relying on patience and guile to exploit holes .  The number of CIA agents in Iran and Lebanon countries is classified - but Iran claimed in May it arrested at least 30 people allegedly linked to a CIA-run spy network .  Hezbollah - backed by Iran - has built a professional counter-intelligence operation they proudly describe as the ` spy combat unit ' .  But the U.S. has had no diplomatic presence in Iran for 30 years and this makes the CIA 's job of finding out what is happening on the ground all the more important .  The report said Iran could start building a nuclear bomb in a matter of months .  The issue of what to do about Iran has came to the fore in the U.S. political scene yesterday after Newt Gingrich , frontrunner in the Republican presidential race , called for regime change in the country .  He said the U.S. and its allies could ` break ' the country within a year by cutting off the country 's fuel supplies and sabotaging its sole oil refinery .  He added that the U.S. should bomb Iran 's facilities to prevent it becoming a nuclear power , but only as a ` last recourse ' .  His hawkish comments will alarm experts who have warned of catastrophic consequences if military action is taken against Iran .  Iran periodically announces the capture or execution of alleged U.S. or Israeli spies , and often no further information is released .  The announcement follows the unravelling by Lebanon 's Hezbollah - an extremist Shiite Muslim group with close links to Iran - of a CIA spy ring in that country .  Hezbollah 's long-time leader , Sheik Hassan Nasrallah , boasted in June on television he had unmasked at least two CIA spies who had infiltrated the ranks of the organisation .  Though the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon officially denied the accusation , American officials conceded that Nasrallah was n't lying and that Hezbollah had subsequently methodically picked off CIA informants .  Earlier this week it was reported that more than a dozen CIA spies had been caught in Iran and Lebanon . The U.S. government now fears they have been executed .  Past explosions : In 1983 more than 300 people - including 260 Americans - were killed in an attack on the U.S. embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut  The spies were said to be paid informants who were targeting Iran and Hezbollah group in Beirut .  Their discovery is a big hindrance to U.S. attempts to track Iran 's nuclear activities and discover if Hezbollah is plotting any attacks against Israel .  Former senior CIA officer Robert Baer worked against Hezbollah in the 1980s and told ABC news that the group will often execute those it believes to be spies .  Other officials pointed out Hezbollah killed more Americans than any other terrorist organisation before the 9/11 attacks .  In 1983 more than 300 people - including 260 Americans - were killed in an attack on the U.S. embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut .  Bob Baer said U.S. spies no longer know the trade well enough  A former senior CIA officer has admitted that the loss of agents is a major setback -- and not an isolated incident .  ` When you lose your entire station , either in Tehran or Beirut , that 's a catastrophe , ' Bob Baer  pictured right  told ABC News .  He said it was due in part to a new generation of agents not using traditional methods of intelligence gathering .  ` They do n't understand tradecraft , ' said Baer , who thinks the CIA has taken on military habits . ` And we have lost our touch in espionage . '  Baer said that simply serving in war zones means many agents are unprepared for other demands . Other CIA officers agree with this .  ` There is an entire generation of case officers who have only met with assets on a base , surrounded by security , ' said one retired officer .  ` It 's not the same as meeting assets on a street , where you are responsible for your own security and surveillance .

73	A father whose four young sons could communicate only in grunts when authorities rescued them from a filthy Denver apartment pleaded guilty to felony child abuse on Thursday .  Wayne Sperling , 67 , could spend up to seven years in prison when he is sentenced on December 30 . He also faced other charges , but these were dropped in exchange for his guilty plea .  He and his wife , Lorinda Bailey , were both charged after their sons , aged two to six , were found in sickening living conditions in their apartment last October .  The abuse was revealed when an emergency room doctor , who was treating the youngest boy for a cut to his forehead , noticed that he was unwashed , smelled of cigarettes and had bruises consistent with pinching .  Scroll down for video  Guilty : Wayne Sperling , pictured in November 2013 , has pleaded guilty to felony child abuse after his four young sons were found living is sickening conditions last year . He faces up to seven years in prison  Authorities discovered Sperling , his 36-year-old wife and the boys living in an apartment filled with cat feces , urine and flies across every surface inside the house .  Prosecutors say it one of the most horrific cases they 've ever seen , but the state 's child abuse laws kept them from pursuing harsher penalties because the boys did not suffer serious physical injuries .  The youngsters were taken in by a foster mother and are improving , prosecutors said .  They have never asked about their parents .  ` Considering what they 've gone through , they 're doing remarkably well , ' Denver District Attorney spokeswoman Lynn Kimbrough said on Thursday . That the boys are living together has ` helped them in their ability to try to recover from the horrifying neglect they were living in . '  Sentenced : His wife Lorinda Bailey , 36 , pictured last year , was sentenced to 90 days in jail last week  After they were rescued and given bagged lunches to eat , the boys acted as if they had n't seen normal food before , Detective Teresa Gessler testified in Bailey 's case .  They patted the sandwiches and played with the apples and after an adult mimed eating an apple to encourage them to eat , they licked the fruit , she said .  When the boys were placed with the foster mother , prosecutor Bonnie Benedetti said , they did not know how to dress themselves .  Benedetti said they are still not all toilet-trained and their snack cupboard has to be kept locked to prevent them from hoarding food .  The case warranted felony charges because it was a repeat child-abuse offense .  Cruel : The couple had already lost three children after being accused of child abuse in 2006  Scene : The couple 's apartment , pictured , in Denver was covered in cat urine and feces and dead flies  The couple , who have a 30-year age gap , lost custody of other children amid similar allegations in October 2006 , after passers-by reported two young children playing in the street .  The children mostly grunted and pointed to communicate , and officers found a home full of trash and rotten food .  Bailey and Sperling pleaded guilty in June 2007 to misdemeanor child abuse in that case .  Bailey was sentenced last week to 90 days in jail and five years of probation after pleading guilty .

74	Waking up with a giant spot on your face prior to an important event is a scenario most women know only too well , but how far would you go to get rid of it ?  You may have tried tea tree oil and serums that claim to zap it away in an instant but , failing those , would you dare dab your own urine on your face in a desperate attempt to banish the pesky zit ?  One author claims that applying urine to your visage can be extremely effective when it comes to treating troublesome skin .  Scroll down for video  Would YOU use urine on your skin to banish a spot ? One healthcare author claims that the trick works wonders on pesky zits thanks to urine 's nutrient dense properties  In Your Own Perfect Medicine , author Martha Christy outlines scientifically-proven and medically-documented studies . She explains that urine therapy - or urotherapy - has historical roots in ancient Egypt , China and India .  Essentially , she claims that thanks to its anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties , urine helps boost immunity to disease .  Martha says that the enzyme , vitamin and mineral-rich liquid should be applied topically to the skin to help with acne , eczema , psoriasis and fungal infections .  Martha goes as far as to suggest that drinking your own urine will boost your health immensely  The nutritional and natural healthcare consultant , who also works as a medical research writer , goes as far as to suggest that drinking your own urine will boost your health immensely .  She refers to JW Armstrong , who fasted on his own urine and water for 45 days , and recommends massaging yourself with urine and even using it as an eye and ear drop .  Urine baths , she says , are beneficial and refers to the women who took urine baths in eighteenth century France .  Indeed , pop star Madonna once claimed to swear by the gross ritual .  Speaking on the David Letterman show , she said : ` Peeing in the shower is really good , it , it fights athlete 's foot .  ` I 'm serious , urine is like an antiseptic , it 's all got to do with the enzymes in your body . '  Ultimately , Martha argues that urine is n't promoted by the healthcare world because it 's free .  Writing for The Telegraph , Rebecca Reid claims that putting urine in your face cream is the latest UK health trend . She explains that her friend was advised to apply it topically by the local while living in Ashram , India .  ` They initially encouraged us to mix some of our urine in with whatever moisturiser we 'd brought with us . I just put some in my Nivea . And it was amazing . My skin was so , so soft , ' she writes .  Shona Wilkinson , Nutritionist at NutriCentre , said : ` Urine typically contains breakdown products from a wide range of foods , drinks , drugs , environmental contaminants , beauty products and waste metabolites of the body .  ` For this reason , the actual content of each individuals urine is totally different . On the whole though , it is approximately 95 per cent water and then 5 per cent nutrients such as calcium , iron , magnesium and zinc .  ` There is no research to show any other benefits than just the 5 per cent nutrients . There has to be a simpler way of getting any benefits of urine that are claimed . I would suggest a glass of water and either a healthy meal or a multi vitamin and mineral tablet - the benefits will far exceed a glass of urine .  ` Overall -- not something I would recommend ! '  Urine therapy is said to date back to the Bible . Historical documents suggest that the Aztecs disinfected wounds with it , while the benefits are also mentioned in Indian and Chinese literature .  Urine is highly sterile , consisting of 95 per cent water and five per cent nutrients such as proteins , vitamins and minerals . During the digestive process , the liver deals with toxins and removes them to be excreted .  The blood then goes to the kidneys where it is filtered again and extraneous components the body no longer needs are collected in a sterile solution which is then passed as urine .  But GP Dr Rob Hicks said : ` Over the years many people have claimed health benefits from drinking their own urine , but as far as I 'm aware there is no scientific evidence to back-up these claims .  ` The kidneys are an efficient filtering system getting rid of what the body does n't need , so to put this back into the body seems counter-productive .  ` Personally , I believe there are better - and more palatable - ways to keep the body healthy including not smoking , eating a healthy diet , and keeping stress under control .

75	The competition included a bear in wellington boots , pink aliens from outer space and a builder called Bob .  But when viewers were asked to choose their favourite BBC children 's character of all time , there was only one who was considered the best in his field -- Shaun the Sheep .  The mischievous sheep knocked Postman Pat and Sooty & Sweep into second and third place respectively , despite only hitting screens with his own show in 2007 . He first appeared in the Oscar-winning Wallace and Gromit film A Close Shave in 1995 .  Shaun the Sheep was voted the top BBC children 's character in the poll followed by Postman Pat and Sooty & Sweep who were second and third  Ben Preston , Radio Times editor , said Shaun the Sheep 's victory was a ` testament to the enduring quality of British children 's television '  The poll , by Radio Times and the British Film Institute , saw 41,000 people vote for their favourite from a shortlist of 50 , all of which were either cartoon characters or puppets .  The results reveal the top three stars from each decade from the 1950s onwards , as well as the most popular for the entire period .  Richard Starzak , creator of the Shaun The Sheep television show , said : ` Many BBC animated characters were a big and important part of my childhood . It 's amazing to think Shaun will be part of so many people 's happy memories . '  Postman Pat came second in the poll which saw 41,000 people vote for their favourite character from a list of 50 , all of which were either cartoon characters or puppets  Radio Times and the British Film Institute did the poll  The series has won two Emmy awards and a Bafta for its 130 episodes .  Postman Pat starred in 141 episodes between 1981 and 2008 detailing his adventures in the village of Greendale .  Sooty and Sweep , the puppet bear and dog who communicate through a series of squeaks , have been an almost constant presence on children 's television for nearly 60 years . Their show was broadcast by the BBC from 1955 until 1967 and then moved to ITV .  Justin Johnson , a children 's TV expert at the BFI , said Shaun the Sheep , Postman Pat and Sooty & Sweep are set apart from their contemporaries by how ` likeable ' they are .  He said : ` None of them are fantastical sci-fi characters , they are very every day , people can relate to them .  ` With Postman Pat and Sooty & Sweep there is the nostalgia value , parents loved the characters so they want their children to as well . But nostalgia only works so far .  ` For these three shows , their strength is fundamentally the quality of the storytelling , that 's what children and parents react to .

Last month the former player , who appeared 57 times for the England national side , admitted to reporters that he had been the victim of bank fraud , losing him up to # 50,000 .

In a documentary aired by ITV in September he described the pain of knowing he might start drinking again even though he recognises it might kill him .  Widely regarded as one of the most talented footballers of his generation , Gascoigne told film-makers he had been ` lucky twice ' after almost dying from drink .  He said : ' I hope I do n't die through it . Because I wo n't get any sympathy ... because well he was warned . At least I know if I did pass away through it I would n't be in this pain all the time .

79	Nobody ever laughed at Luis Suarez . Racist abuse is n't funny . Biting an opponent is n't funny . Diving and cheating is n't terribly amusing either .  So quite what Suarez meant when he suggested ` people in England laughed ' about his ` attitude over the last few years ' is anybody 's guess .  All that can be said is that the Uruguay striker was utterly humourless when he spoke to the assembled English media in a corner of the post-match interview area here on Thursday .  VIDEO : Scroll down to watch Suarez 's emotional dressing room message to wife and kids  Revenge mission : Luis Suarez has hit back at his critics after downing England  Payback time : Suarez felt no remorse about sinking his adopted home  He was cold , impassive . Nothing like the man we had just seen kiss his physiotherapist on the head before blubbing in the dug-out . No , after a shower and an encounter with doping control this was now payback time . This was a chance to settle a score by delivering a not-so-polite ` up yours ' to his adopted home .  Which was a pity given how prepared we English were to acknowledge his brilliance . To acknowledge the sheer force of will he displayed in almost singlehandedly destroying England 's hapless defence .  We knew he was a world-class talent . It was why he was crowned the best player in the country by both his peers and the Press .  But to perform at that level on Thursday only weeks after he was being pushed around in a wheelchair was incredible .  Tribute : Suarez celebrated his opening goal with the Uruguay physio who helped get him fit after surgery  It was an achievement that commanded our respect . Sadly that respect does not seem to go both ways and this is not about the English media -- which is irrelevant -- but about his colleagues at Anfield , the people of Liverpool and beyond .  The people who were prepared to forgive and forget and recognise that here was someone who addressed his issues and became a better player , and a better man , as a result .  Now , however , you have to question just how genuine he was . In fact , you start to question a number of things he has said in recent months and wonder whether the real Suarez has just resurfaced again .  The same Suarez we saw agitating for a move away from Liverpool last year . Who even resorted to questioning the honesty and integrity of his manager , Brendan Rodgers .  Only last month he said he was committed to remaining with Liverpool . That he signed his new contract last December because he was now totally committed to the Anfield cause .  Deft touch : Suarez headed past Joe Hart to set Uruguay on their way  My best manager  Sven Goran Eriksson . Far from perfect but made three consecutive quarter-finals and masterminded big wins against top opposition .  My favourite momentThe 5-1 win in Germany is the most exciting match I 've witnessed covering England .  My favourite player  Rio Ferdinand . There have been more gifted players , but he was a top class centre half -- something we 're missing .  ` I signed the contract because I love it here , ' he said . ` If you 're not happy here you do n't sign any contract . '  Before Liverpool 's players went their separate ways for the summer he also told them he was going nowhere . Steven Gerrard was certainly of the view that Suarez would give Liverpool at least one more season .  More worrying for Liverpool is the apparent disregard for the reception he is sure to receive in the Premier League after making his remarks . The suspicion must be that he does not fear the inevitable hostility because he does not intend to return to England .  On Friday the Spanish newspapers were dominated by speculation regarding Suarez . The hierarchy at Real Madrid were thought to have been encouraged by Suarez 's post-match comments , sensing there might now be a chance to pounce .  Defying the odds : Suarez had surgery on a knee injury just a month ago  In Barcelona it is claimed that a deal is all but done . Whether the Catalans have the financial clout to make such a move remains to be seen .  But Mundo Deportivo , the Barcelona sports daily , reported that the club had not only identified Suarez as their top target but said talks are very serious .  They wrote of an $ 85million release clause in Suarez 's contract that would be lowered by $ 20 million should Real Madrid or Barcelona make a bid .  And they salivated over the prospect of Suarez partnering Lionel Messi and Neymar in the most formidable attack in Europe . At the same time , they said Alexis Sanchez might move to Liverpool .  The report also highlighted the added attraction for Suarez of having the in-laws round the corner .  Apparently his wife 's family live in Castelldefels , a Barcelona suburb where the likes of Messi currently reside .  ` I want to see what they think now , ' was how Suarez signed off his message to those he considers his detractors . Presumably from a safer vantage point , somewhere in Spain .

81	A school girl who collapsed and suffered a cardiac arrest in the school playground has woken up after spending five months in a coma .  Emma Ross , 10 , stopped breathing when her father came to collect her from school in February and was placed in a medically-induced coma .  The youngster , who woke up a few weeks ago , is now recovering from a pioneering operation to fit a pump to help her condition .  Emma is the first child to be fitted with a # 27,000 Baclofen pump , having been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy - a disease of the heart muscle .  Emma Ross , 10 ,  pictured in hospital with her mother  stopped breathing when her father came to collect her from school in February and was placed in a medically-induced coma  The device was fitted at Yorkhill Children 's Hospital in Glasgow after a three-hour operation yesterday .  It will allow drugs to be injected directly into her spine , which will hopefully stop the painful involuntary muscle spasms , which Emma has endured .  Emma 's mother , Robyn Stewart , 32 , said : ` I was told so many times that she was not going to make it , but she has made so much progress . She is my wee miracle .  'Em ma had her op and it all went well , so we are so relieved .  ` The surgery is very rare , she will be the first child to have that type of pump fitted in the hospital .  ` We are now hoping that it will help relax her muscles so she will be able to move around because right now her muscles are so tight and stiff .  ` She is awake and aware of people . She can sometimes move her hands and feet . If a song comes on that she likes then she will move her feet around .  ` All I want is for her to talk and tell me how she feels .

She is pictured above  left with her couusin Lois and right  before she had the cardiac arrest  The schoolgirl from Dumfries stopped breathing for 44 minutes and turned blue when her father Lindsay , 36 , came to collect her from Heathhall Primary in February .  Doctors battled to save her life at Dumfries Infirmary before she was rushed to Yorkhill Children 's Hospital in Glasgow and placed in a medically induced coma .  Ms Stewart has spoken of her fear at seeing her little girl lying ` dead ' in the playground .  Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle .  It can run in families and can affect one or many members of a family .  There are three different types of cardiomyopathy and each affects the size and shape of the heart .  They can also affect the heart 's electrical system .  There is a small risk of sudden death in people with cardiomyopathy .  Source : British Heart Foundation  She said : ` When I arrived I saw Emma lying dead and motionless . She was completely blue and she was not breathing . Her teacher Mrs Black was standing over her giving CPR .  ` Since then it has been an absolute roller-coaster , we 've had good days and bad days . She can now make noises , grunts and groans .  ` There was a high risk with the operation as it took three hours - she could possibly have had another cardiac arrest .  ` I know she is going to pull through . She had a chance to leave me and she did n't . Three times I was told she was not going to make it , but she is still fighting . '  Emma has now been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy , which is the same disease of the heart muscle that almost killed footballer Fabrice Muamba in 2012 .  She spent her 10th birthday in hospital last month , while she was barely conscious , but her party had to be cancelled because she urgently needed a feeding tube inserted in her stomach .  Her parents have been able to take Emma out of hospital in her wheelchair and her mum said she is always smiling .  Emma 's mother Robyn Stewart , said her daughter ` is awake and aware of people . She can sometimes move her hands and feet . If a song comes on that she likes then she will move her feet around ' .

Emma is pictured left with her cousin Lois  right  in a trip away from the hospital  They have another daughter called Evie who is 18 months old and say they have been ` overwhelmed ' by the support and kindness of people who have read Emma 's story .  ` Folk have been brilliant . We have been absolutely overwhelmed with all the support , ' Ms Stewart said .  St Michael 's Church and donations from the public have enabled the family to stay near Emma in hospital .  They will be doing a 10k run on August 31 along with Emma 's friends and teachers to raise money for Ronald McDonald House , which is a charity that provides free accommodation for 500 families each year whose children are critically ill patients in Yorkhill Hospital .  People can sponsor Ms Stewart 's run by visiting her Just Giving page .  Emma  pictured in hospital  can now make noises , grunts and groans but can not yet talk  Contrary to popular belief , a cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack .  A cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating due to a malfunction in its electrical system .  It is caused by an abnormal rhythm , or arrhythmia .  Anyone can suffer a cardiac arrest and it can happen at any time and without warning .  Symptoms include unresponsiveness , loss of consciousness , lack of pulse and stopping breathing .  In contrast , a heart attack can be thought of as a problem with the heart 's plumbing - it occurs when an artery supplying the heart becomes blocked .  This causes the heart muscle to begin to die slowly while the patient usually remains awake and alert .

82	By Mario Ledwith  PUBLISHED :  14:36 EST , 1 February 2013   |  UPDATED :  15:27 EST , 1 February 2013  Opponents of Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi brought chaos to the streets of Cairo as they bombarded the presidential palace with petrol bombs .  Security forces used tear gas and water cannons to try to control the raging crowd on the eighth day of political violence sweeping the country .  Around 6,000 protesters gathered outside the palace in an upscale district of the capital , banging on the gates and throwing stones and shoes into the grounds in a show of contempt .  Attack : An Egyptian protester rushes away during clashes in front of the presidential palace in Cairo on as thousands of Egyptians took to the streets to protest  opposition : Around 6,000 protestors marched outside the Cairo palace in a show of opposition to the Islamist President and his Muslim Brotherhood  The protesters accuse Mursi of betraying the spirit of the revolution by concentrating too much power in his own hands and those of his Muslim Brotherhood .  Crowds chanted ` Leave , leave , ' in a clear message to the under-pressure politician . .  Security forces inside the palace responded by firing water cannons at the crowd , then volleys of tear gas , injuring at least 15 people .  The streets outside the palace became a scene of mayhem as police fired volley after volley of tear gas trying to drive back the protesters , who rained stones on the riot police .  ` This is all because of Morsi , ' one protester shouted . At least 15 people were injured in the clashes , police said .  Thousands more rallied in central Tahrir Square , while a larger crowd marched through the Suez Canal city of Port Said .  Defence : Police at the palace responded by firing tear gas and using water canons at the protestors  Injuries : Police said that at least 15 people had been injured in the violent exchanges  The demonstrations mark the second anniversary of the uprising that overthrew Hosni Mubarak .  The country 's most influential Islamic had attempted to ease tensions by gathering rival political leaders for crisis talks on Thursday .  He persuaded them to sign up to a charter disavowing violence and committing to dialogue , after the head of the army to warn this week that the state was on the verge of collapse .  But the talks were overshadowed when the President 's opponents called for nationwide protests .  The Muslim Brotherhood accuses Mursi 's opponents of trying to bring down Egypt 's first democratically elected leader and to seize power through street unrest .  In a statement released last night , leftist leader Hamdeen Sabahi said signing the peace initiative did not mean an end to the protests .  He said he would not enter dialogue until bloodshed was halted , the state of emergency lifted and those responsible for the previous week 's violence brought to justice .  Leave : A protestor accidentally catches outside the palace , where demonstrators chanted ` leave , leave '  Fatal : The wave of political demonstration is in its eighth day , with 60 people have been killed  The rise of Mursi , an elected Islamist , after generations of rule by authoritarian , secular military men in the most populous Arab state , is seen as one of the most significant results of the Arab Spring .  But his tenure has failed to unite Egyptians and protests have made the country seem all but ungovernable .  The instability has worsened an economic crisis , forcing Cairo to drain currency reserves to prop up its pound .  Recent violence has been worst in cities along the Suez Canal , especially Port Said , where demonstrators were enraged by death sentences given to 21 football fans for involvement in fatal stadium riots last year .  Dozens of protesters were shot dead in Port Said and Mursi responded by imposing a state of emergency and curfew .  Brotherhood supporters battled protesters outside the presidential palace during protests against Mursi in December .  Revolution : Opponents accuse Mursi of concentrating too much power in his own hands following the revolution two years ago  Protests : Thousands more rallied in central Tahrir Square , while a larger crowd marched through the Suez Canal city of Port Said  Collapse : Clashes led the head of the army to warn that the state could be on the verge of collapse  Critics accused the Brotherhood of deploying a militia against the demonstrators , but keen to avoid a repeat , the Islamists have so far kept off the streets during the latest wave of protests .  Thursday 's meeting of political leaders was convened by Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayyeb , head of the 1,000-year-old al-Azhar university and mosque , one of the few institutions still seen as neutral .  He persuaded participants to sign a document pledging to renounce violence and agree to set up a committee to plan more talks .  That marked a climbdown by Mursi 's foes who had previously rebuffed invitations to negotiate , demanding that Mursi first promise to include them in a unity government .  The presidency said the initiative was ` an important step on the road to achieving stability in the Egyptian street ' .  But it is far from clear that opposition politicians could call off the street demonstrations , even if they wanted to .  The protest movement has become a spontaneous expression of anger , often only loosely allied to the secularist and liberal parties running against the Brotherhood in elections .  	  6,000 protestors marched outside Mohamed Mursi 's palace in Cairo    Security forces fired tear gas and water cannons at demonstrators    Eighth day of political violence that has left around 60 people dead    Other demonstrations took place in Tahrir Square and in Port Said	By Mario Ledwith  PUBLISHED :  14:36 EST , 1 February 2013   |  UPDATED :  15:27 EST , 1 February 2013  Opponents of Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi brought chaos to the streets of Cairo as they bombarded the presidential palace with petrol bombs .

Wal-Mart will reimburse customers who bought the tainted ` Five Spice ' donkey meat and is helping local food and industry agencies in eastern Shandong province investigate its Chinese supplier , it said late on Wednesday in official posts on China 's Twitter-like Weibo . The Shandong Food and Drug Administration earlier said the product contained fox meat .  The scandal could dent Wal-Mart 's reputation for quality in China 's $ 1 trillion food and grocery market where it plans to open 110 new stores in the next few years . China is the largest grocery market in the world and is set to grow to $ 1.5 trillion by 2016 , according to the Institute of Grocery Distribution .

CMR estimates Wal-Mart 's market share fell from 7.5 percent to 5.2 percent over the last three years .  Donkey meat is a popular snack in some areas of China , although it only accounts for a tiny fraction of overall meat consumption . In 2011 China slaughtered 2.4 million donkeys , according to country 's livestock industry yearbook .  Wal-Mart , French grocer Carrefour SA , McDonald 's Corp and KFC-parent Yum Brands Inc among others , have come under fire before in China over food safety issues , a sensitive topic in a country riddled with scares from a fatal tainted milk scandal to recycled `` gutter oil '' used for cooking.Wal-Mart said it had set up an investigation team to look into the incident , would strengthen food safety rules and take legal action against the product supplier . It added the person in charge at the supplier factory had already been detained . ` We are deeply sorry for this whole affair , ' said Wal-Mart 's China president and CEO , Greg Foran . ` It is a deep lesson  for us  that we need to continue to increase investment in supplier management .

Wal-Mart was also fined that year in China for selling duck meat past its expiry date .  Food safety scandals can have a significant impact in China . Yum has struggled to recover sales in China more than a year after a chicken supplier to KFC in the country was found to have used excess levels of antibiotics .

87	It may not have made the final cut of Hollywood 's history , but a film historian says major American film studios collaborated with Nazi Germany in the lead up to the Second World War .  From investing in German rearmament to editing out references to crimes being committed against Jews , studios including MGM , Paramount and 20th Century Fox failed to stand up to Hitler , Ben Urwand claims .  ' I want to bring out a hidden episode in Hollywood history and an episode that has not been reported accurately , ' the Harvard scholar said .  Cancelled : A movie adaptation of the political novel and theater show It Ca n't Happen Here was dropped  Although other film historians dispute his claims , Urwand believes that Hollywood studio chiefs were happy to work with Nazi censors to change or cancel productions so that they could keep access to the German film market .  From 1932 , Nazi laws meant studios could have their licenses revoked if they produced films , shown in Germany or abroad , that were considered offensive to Germans .  In his book , The Collaboration : Hollywood 's Pact with Hitler , Urwand said that Hollywood was happy to bow to Hitler 's demands .  ` Collaboration : it 's not my word or invention . I got it from materials from both sides . It 's the word that 's regularly used to describe their relationship , ' the 35-year-old told the Guardian .  He added that the German head of MGM spoke of the ` satisfying collaboration on both sides ' to the press .  Movie critic : Historian Ben Urwand has researched the reach of Nazi influence on Hollywood before the war  Protest : Goebbels ordered Germans to disrupt screenings of the film All Quiet on the Western Front , above  MGM also invested in German rearmament to get around currency export restrictions , the historian said .  Urwand believes that filmmakers not only wanted to continue working during the build up to the war , they also thought Hitler may win the war and wanted to safeguard the future of their businesses .  MGM , Paramount and 20th-Century Fox did not leave Germany until mid-1940 . But even after Hollywood started making anti-Nazi films , it continued to erase reference to the Jews because studio chiefs , including Jewish refugees , wanted to ` avoid special pleading on their behalf ' .  Urwand said studio bosses could not claim ignorance of the atrocities being carried out against the Jews because they had been forced to fire Jewish employees .  ` Hollywood is collaborating and the Nazis are having the final say on several important movies that would have exposed what was going on in Germany , ' he said .  He added : ' I would n't want what I write to be generalisable about Jews , but specific Jews in the movie business made decisions to work with Nazi leaders . '  Urwand , whose Jewish grandparents went into hiding in the war , added : ` It was -LSB- Jack -RSB- Warner who personally ordered that the word `` Jew '' be removed from all dialogue in the 1937 film The Life of Emile Zola '' . ''  Censor : Propaganda minister Goebbels talks to the Hitler Youth in Berlin in 1935  He told the New York Times Warner 's studio was the first to invite Nazi officials to Los Angeles to suggest cuts .  Warner was also said to have taken a cruise on Hitler 's old yacht in 1945 , where he discussed post-war business opportunities , Urwand claims .  The historian found a letter from January 1938 in which a 20th Century Fox worker was asking Hitler about his views on films . The letter was signed ` Heil Hitler ' .  Studios were also visited by a Nazi consultant , who would demand edits to films seen as being anti-German .  There are also instances of whole films being dropped , like the 1936 MGM movie It Ca n't Happen Here , which showed democracy winning over fascism .  War years : MGM is one of the studios Urwand says collaborated with Nazi Germany  The film , based on Nobel laureate Sinclair Lewis 's novel , was banned over ` fear of international politics ' and the potential of boycotts abroad .  Nazi meddling in Hollywood has been well documented , even at the time . A headline in Newsweek in 1937 read : Long Arm of Hitler Extends to Hollywood Studio .  Urwand however , has looked at how much Hollywood bent to accommodate Hitler 's wishes .  He claims that Nazi interference in the film industry began with the release of All Quiet on the Western Front in 1930 , when Joseph Goebbels told protesters to set off stink bombs and release mice in the movie theaters .  Carl Laemmle , the Jewish German-American head of Universal , then agreed to cuts .  Hitler was said to have enjoyed films such as Mutiny on the Bounty and The Lives of a Bengal Lancer . He also liked Mr Smith Goes to Washington , because it showed democracy in a poor light .  And while he is said to have liked Laurel and Hardy , Hitler was not keen on Charlie Chaplin 's portray of him in The Great Dictator , according to the Guardian .  Screen test : Hitler was not amused at Charlie Chaplin 's performance in The Great Dictator  However , rival historian Tom Doherty claims that U.S. commerce department files show that rather than working with the Nazis , MGM had been advised to invest in armaments to get around currency being blocked .  ' I do n't see sinister , greedy monsters . I see people trying to cope with this bizarre anomaly and negotiate in a way that made sense to them , ' the author of Hollywood and HItler : 1933-1939 , said .  Others have highlighted how the same studio heads who complied with Nazi censorship also paid for a spy ring .  ` The moguls who have been castigated for putting business ahead of Jewish identity and loyalty were in fact working behind the scenes to help Jews , ' Steven Ross , of the University of Southern California , said .

88	The blood of hundreds of baby seals has stained the pristine white snow of Canada 's ice floes as the world 's largest annual marine mammal slaughter begins .  Horrifying images taken only yesterday show seals being shot and wounded before they are dragged onto a vessel - where they clubbed to death for their fur .  Photographs of this year 's commercial hunt off the coast of Newfoundland were captured by animal rights charity Humane Society International  HSI  who say the baby animals ` are dying a violent death for fur products that nobody is buying ' .  Horrific : Humane Society International has captured shocking images of seals being clubbed to death on Canada 's ice floes  pictured  as this year 's ` commercial hunt ' gets underway  Cruel : Images show the animals - who are eventually skinned for their fur - being shot and wounded on the thin ice before being dragged  pictured  onto vessels  Chilling : The seals who do not die from the gunshot wounds are dragged onto ships  pictured  where they are clubbed to death  Gruesome : The baby animals  pictured  are suffering a violent death ` for fur products nobody wants ' according to Humane Society International  Inhumane : Some seals die from the gunshot wounds  top  while others escape into the water where they slowly die from their injuries  bottom   Blood-stained : Once the animals are shot , sealers retrieve the bodies by impaling them with a sharpened hook  pictured  which forces the seals that are still alive to violently thrash out  Cruel : The images HSI took from a helicopter above Newfoundland 's ice floes show sealers  pictured  pulling the seal 's blood-stained carcasses onto their ship  The disturbing images show the animals thrashing in pain as they are pulled across the blood-stained snow while others are seen impaled on the boat 's deck .  HSI 's executive director Rebecca Aldworth said : ` This is the 17th year that I have witnessed the seal slaughter . The suffering I have seen is impossible to forget . If the killing happened in view of the public , it would have been shut down decades ago . But it occurs far offshore .  ` We saw one baby seal clearly raise her head from the massive pool of blood she lay in . Another was shot and thrashed on the ice only to slip into the blood-slicked water .  ` It is reprehensible that these baby seals are being killed with government financing , even as the largest seal processor in Canada admits to warehousing a stockpile of seal fur . '  The Newfoundland government has authorised the killing of up to 468,000 harp , hooded and grey seals , according to HSI . They claim the seals - many of which are just a few weeks old - are shot , clubbed and skinned for their fur despite a decreasing global demand for them .  Killing : Even Sir Paul McCartney who visited a seal nursery with HSI in 2006 has made an emotional plea for Canada to stop the seal hunt  pictured   Unforgiving : The animals are slaughtered in a remote region off the coast of Newfoundland  pictured  - HSI says if the killing happened in view of the public ` it would have been shut down decades ago '  Brutal : Veterinary experts claim the seals are killed inhumanely in the commercial hunt  pictured  because of the harsh environment in which it occurs and the speed at which they are killed  Barbaric : HSI 's executive director says ` it is reprehensible that these baby seals  pictured  are being killed with government financing '  Demand : The country 's largest purchaser of sealskin announced that it will no longer purchase the fur from seals who are killed and skinned  pictured  during commercial hunts  Innocent : Government reports found 98 percent of the seals  pictured  killed in the Canadian commercial seal slaughter are less than three months of age , according to HSI  The demand for seal products diminished greatly after the European Union , United States , Switzerland , Mexico , Taiwan and the Customs Union of Russia , Belarus , Kazakhstan and Armenia banned the trade of some or all products of commercial seal hunts .  With China also blocking attempts to import seal meat into the country , the price of seal products from Canada declined rapidly and convinced many ` sealers ' to abandon the act .  Sir Paul McCartney who visited a seal nursery with HSI in 2006 has made an emotional plea for Canada to stop the seal hunt .  The former Beatle said : ` Canada 's brutal commercial seal hunt has begun , and once again thousands of baby seals will be shot and bludgeoned to make fur products that nobody wants or needs .  ` Videos of the bloody seal slaughter provide the only vital evidence to demonstrate year after year that these seals are dying a horrible death for their fur . '  In recent years , Newfoundland 's government has reportedly dished out # 6million in subsidies to seal processing plants to ` prop up the dying industry ' - and announced a further # 1.3 million earlier this month .  ` It is a double tragedy , ' according to HSI spokesperson Wendy Higgins who told MailOnline : ` They -LSB- seals -RSB- are suffering for frivolous fur products and Canada ca n't even sell the fur because more and more countries around the world are boycotting sales because of the horrendous cruelty . '  ` We want the Canadian government to offer a buy-out to the sealers and put and end to this senseless slaughter .  ` The hunt is legal but that does n't mean that the killing is always done according to what few guidelines govern the industry and HSI has frequently documented breaches .  ` Even if they did always kill the seals according to the rules , it 's still a dreadfully brutal process ... This hunt is taking place many hundreds of miles out with absolutely no-one there to monitor what they 're doing . '  Immoral : Even though the hunt  pictured  is legal in Canada , animal rights campaigners say it 's still a dreadfully brutal process  Shocking : The Newfoundland government has authorised the killing of up to 468,000 seals  pictured  this year , despite declining global demand for their fur  Hunted : The boss of a company who accepted government funds to continue purchasing sealskin said ` it 's probably not a really good time to get in this industry '  Death : As many as half-a-million seals  pictured  will be hunted and killed in this year 's cull  Only this week the country 's largest purchaser of sealskin announced that it will no longer purchase seal fur , citing a lack of demand and a warehouse full of it .  Carino Processing Ltd also refused over # 600,000 in financing from the Newfoundland government . But a new company PhocaLux International is accepting government funds and has stated it will purchase around 30,000 seal furs , according to CBC .  The firm 's Chief Executive told the news channel ` the markets are n't really great around the world ... it 's probably not a really good time to get in this industry . '  Government reports confirmed that 98 percent of the seals killed in the Canadian commercial seal slaughter are pups less than three months of age , according to HSI .  Veterinary experts have stated that Canada 's commercial seal hunt is inherently inhumane because of the remote , harsh environment in which it occurs and the speed at which the killing is conducted for commercial and safety reasons .

90	An Indian farmer has decided not to sell his prized bull it fetched a world record price of # 1.23 million because he already earns more than # 30,000 a month selling its highly-sought after semen .  If Karamvir Singh had gone ahead with the sale , it would have made his three-year-old bull , called Bheem Donor , the most expensive in the world .  But after selling off the bull 's brother , Yuvi Donor , for the equivalent of # 860,000 , Mr Singh is not in a rush to get rid of the 1,200 kg bull .  Farmer Karamvir Singh is keeping hold of his prized bull Bheem Donor , pictured together , despite the animal fetching a world record price of # 1.23 million at auction  The Murrah breed bull would provide plenty of meat , but his real value comes from the 4 to 5ml of high quality semen he produces every day , which is in demand across the country .  Mr Singh , who lives in Sunario village located in the Kurukshetra region of Northern India 's Haryana State , said : ' I do n't see the need to rush into selling him given that I can earn over # 30,000 a month from selling his semen . '  He also makes a similar amount from the bull that fathered Bheem .  He added that Bheem Donor was ` like a son to him ' - and a very profitable one .  The 1,200 kg Murrah breed bull produces 4 to 5ml of semen a day , which earns Mr Singh # 30,000 a month  The bull consumes around # 20 worth of food every day , but it 's a worthwhile investment as its breed is known for selling for high prices  One of the reasons that semen from the family is so expensive is due to the fact that the mother of Bheem and Yuvi , produces up to 26litres of milk every day - a record-breaking amount for a Murrah buffalo .  But while Mr Singh regularly brings in a small fortune from the bull , it consumes around # 20 worth of food every day .  This is a considerable amount considering the monthly wage for many people in rural communities across the country is around # 100 .  The auction took place at a three-day fair organised in Jagraon by the Progressive Dairy Farmers ' Association .  The Murrah breed of Water buffalo  Bubalus bubalis  is a type of domestic water buffalo kept for dairy production .  They originate from the Punjab and Haryana states of India and Pakistan and are jet black in colour , have closely curled horns and sometimes have white markings on their face and legs .

92	Sarah Palin 's teleprompter did freeze in Iowa on Saturday , the former Alaska governor claimed during a Tuesday night interview in which a Fox News Channel host asked her about her rambling and at times incoherent speech that sent her political stock plummeting .  The admission came in a freewheeling television segment with Host Sean Hannity in which she declared war on his fellow host Bill O'Reilly for not taking her and real estate tycoon Donald Trump seriously as politicians .  Palin also downplayed reports from days earlier that she was planning to run for president in the first place .  ' I was asked by a testy reporter while I was promoting my Sportsman Channel show , `` Amazing America with Sarah Palin '' , ' the self-promoting pol told Fox host Sean Hannity . ' I was asked if I were to be interested at all in running for office , maybe the presidency . '  ` And it 's certainly not newsworthy , ' she added with a shrug and an eye roll , ` for me to have answered , `` Oh yeah , I 'm interested , yeah . Next question ? ''  SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS  WHO , ME ? Former VP nominee Sarah Palin insisted Tuesday night that she did n't really mean to say she 's interested in the presidency -- unless Fox host Bill O'Reilly is belittling her  then she 's totally IN !   REVISIONIST HISTORY : Sean Hannity  left  asked Palin if her teleprompter malfunctioned on Saturday in Iowa and she said it had , just like during her 2008 acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention -- but reporters who witnessed that speech said the prompter worked fine back then  ` The man can only ride you when your back is bent , ' Palin said during her rambling speech Saturday in Iowa after the prompter DID freeze , as audience members looked at each other quizzically  Palin , the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee , made news on Saturday when she flipped through a binder of notes and strung together a series of odd one-liners after her teleprompter went on the fritz at the Iowa Freedom Summit , leaving her audience confused even as some rooted for her .  But she defended herself Tuesday night on Fox News .  ` Did the teleprompter go down ? Did you have trouble with the copy ? ' Hannity asked her . ` Was there any moment in the speech where you had any difficulty ? Because people have been so critical . '  Palin insisted that ' I do n't read the praise and I do n't read the criticism . ... I 'm used to teleprompters not working . '  ` Remember the GOP acceptance speech back in ' 08 ? The teleprompter broke there too . It did n't work , and I kept on going . '  That 's an exaggeration , according to journalists who were in Minneapolis , Minnesota the night she accepted the role as Arizona Sen. John McCain 's running mate that would vault her onto the national stage .  ` The teleprompter did not break , ' reporter Jonathan Martin , then of Politico , wrote at the time . ` Sarah Palin delivered a powerful speech last night , but she did not `` wing it '' . '  ' I was sitting in the press section next to the stage , within easy eyeshot of the teleprompter , ' he wrote . ' I frequently looked up at the machine , and there was no serious malfunction . A top convention planner confirms this morning that there were no major problems . '  US News & World Report blogger Robert Schlesinger wrote much the same thing : that he was ` was sitting in the press section ,  behind Palin and off to her right side  . I had a clear view of the TelePrompTer , and read along with her . '  In Saturday 's Iowa speech , however , she was indeed improvising .  This reporter , sitting above her in the front row of the stage-right balcony , saw the prompter freeze -- and stay frozen .   ` The man can only ride you when your back is bent , ' she said at one point , as audience members looked at each other quizzically .  ` So strengthen it ! Then the man ca n't ride you , America wo n't get taken for a ride , because so much is at stake . '  BEWILDERED : Palin 's audience often seemed unsure what to make of her as she babbled and danced from subject to subject making little sense  On Tuesday she lashed out at Bill O'Reilly for treating her and Donald Trump like long-shot candidates -- insisting that a cable network perceived to lean right should back her all the way  Addressing the controversy over the virtues of the late Navy SEAL Chris Kyle and the ` American Sniper ' film that tells his life story , she shouted : `` Screw the left in Hollywood ! '  And at one point she lashed out at Muslim terrorists in a style all her own .  ` What we do is strengthen our military , ' she said . ` We respect our troops and let them -- our troops as our gatekeepers -- we let them tell jihadists , `` Uh-uh , this is our house ! Get the hell out '' . '  The 35-minute performance was so uneven that Democratic National Committee Communications Director Mo Elleithee issued a two-word statement afterward : ` Thank you ! '  Palin spoke at the Iowa event alongside a host of others whose names have been floated as potential GOP candidates , including Ted Cruz , Chris Christie and Mike Huckabee .  Her position near the end of the lineup indicated that the event 's hosts , Citizens United and Iowa Congressman Steve King , hoped the Alaskan would be a showstopper .  She nearly stopped the entire show .  Palin , a Fox News contributor , took a shot at top-rated host Bill O'Reilly on Tuesday for dismissing her as a third ` tier potential candidate , even as she sought to distance herself from any expectation that she might run .  FOX & FRENEMIES : Fox host Bill O'Reilly dismissed Palin and Trump on Tuesday as third-tier politicians who merely ` liven up the proceedings '  Trump , a multibillionaire real estate tycoon , says he 's serious about throwing his hat in the ring this time around , after several previous campaigns where he folded his tent before the process got properly underway  O'Reilly had handicapped the fast-moving Republican primary season two hours earlier , saying that ` Sarah Palin and Donald Trump certainly liven up the proceedings , but they need effective organizations in 50 states and that will be a major challenge for them . '  Palin was n't amused , and lashed out at him for not siding with her and other conservatives .  ` Hillary will be running , ' she said , referring to Democratic former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , ` and she will be , you know , the knighted candidate on the left and with the media . '  ` Knowing what the media is going to do , It 's gon na take more than a village to beat Hillary . There needs to be unity , understanding that we have that -- conservatives have that strike against us , you know , right off the bat . '  She complained about how O'Reilly had been teasing his show all day on Fox , which she labeled ` kind of a quasi - or assumed-conservative outlet , '  ` And that would be , `` Oh , all these GOP contenders thinking about running for president -- like Donald Trump , Sarah Palin . '' And he names 'em off , he says , `` Oh , what a reality show that would be ! Yuk , yuk ! '' '  ` Well the left does n't do that , okay ? They , they , they take this serious , because this is war ! And hopefully the media , even the quasi-right side of the media , wo n't be looking at this as some kind of reality show , a joke .

95	Daniel Morcombe 's killer Brett Peter Cowan will appeal his murder conviction in a hearing next month .  However , the attorney general will also appeal Cowan 's sentence at that time , arguing that 20 years non-parole is ` manifestly inadequate ' for Cowan 's crime , which could see the 45-year-old 's prison time extended .  In March , Cowan was found guilty of murder , indecent treatment of a child and interfering with a corpse , after abusing and killing Daniel in an abandoned house after abducting the teen from a Sunshine Coast bus stop .  A covert police operation culminated in Cowan 's arrest in August 2011 , after Cowan unknowingly confessed to Daniel 's murder on camera to an undercover detective .  Cowan 's defence will now claim that showing his video confession was illegal , with Cowan 's lawyer arguing ` they should never have been played to the jury ' .  Scroll down for video  Daniel Morcombe 's killer Brett Peter Cowan mugshot , four months into his prison sentence in July this year  Daniel Morcombe parents Denise and Bruce and brothers Bradley and Dean leave Brisbane court after Cowan was found guilty for the murder of Daniel in March  Daniel Morcombe was only 13 when he was abducted and murdered in December 2003 , waiting at a bus stop to go Christmas shopping  The appeal will be heard on November 27 and 28 .  The defence is reliant on a Canadian precedent , which saw a convicted murderer re-trialled after the jury was shown his confession video in the High Court trial .  ` Really the centre-point of the whole argument is the admissions that Brett made to the undercover officers should never have seen the light of day , ' Cowan 's lawyer , Tim Meehan told Nine News .  ` If that evidence is out , the case against Brett becomes particularly weak . '  Mr Meehan says that Cowan , currently in isolation at maximum security prison Wolston Correctional Service , is in good spirits due to his upcoming appeal .  ` He 's very happy that he 's got a date , he 's very keen for the appeal to run . '  ` It could change his life incredibly if he got a retrial .

They are not concerned , telling Nine News that they were prepared for Cowan to appeal his conviction .  ` To be honest , we 're quite comfortable with the appeal process , we knew it was always going to happen , ' said Bruce Morcombe .  They are also not concerned with the precedent at the Canadian High Court , maintaining that international rulings ` bear no relevance ' on proceedings in Australia .  The Morcombes are preparing for the 10th annual Day for Daniel on Friday , a day held to raise awareness about child safety and educating children so they know how to protect themselves .  Daniel 's parents Bruce and Denise are comfortable with the appeal process as they ` always knew it was going to happen '  Cheeky boys : Bradley Morcombe  left  and twin brother Daniel as young boys . In 2003 at the age of 13 , Daniel , was abducted and murdered although his family did not know what had happened to him until his remains were uncovered in 2011 after a long police investigation and the family was able to lay him to rest . Bradley said of his twin this year , there had not been a day since that he had n't thought of him  When Cowan was imprisoned , he had special food requests such as Coco Pops rejected , but in his cell he has his own TV , radio , toilet and shower .  He will be kept in solitary confinement during his time inside purely for his own protection from prison inmates .  In some cases , according to prison staff , Cowan requires high level escorts when he leaves his cell to guard him down the halls during weekly visits to the doctor .  He visits a gym , a concrete room with a single sun-drenched window , which is the only time he ever gets to see life life outside .  Bruce Morcombe said he knows Cowan would be doing it tough , and quite frankly , did n't care much for his treatment behind bars .

96	A gang of elite British Army soldiers who smuggled drugs and guns into the UK have been jailed for a combined total of almost 50 years today .  Trooper Lemar Loveless , 26 , masterminded the operation to bring a cache of guns , ammunition and # 70,000 worth of cocaine through the Channel Tunnel loaded into the back of BMWs .  He had discharged himself from the Queen 's Royal Hussars , the most senior light cavalry regiment of the British Army , just days before his arrest .  Lemar Loveless , left , the ringleader of the gang and Trave Dyce , right , were caught by immigration officials after they brought the guns and drugs through the Channel Tunnel in BMWs  Lance Laurent , left , had supplied the car for the operation while Duran Wright , right , was heavily involved in the planning  Immigration officials discovered three boxed pistols with ammunition in the back of the BMWs  Loveless was caught out by immigration officials in Folkestone along with regimental colleague Trave Dyce , 22 .  The pair had five guns , including two Walther PPKs favoured by fictional spy James Bond , along with three silencers , ammunition , and half a kilo of cocaine , Woolwich Crown Court heard today .  The court heard the operation was well-planned and included wrapping the illegal stash in curry powder lined tape to try to evade detection by sniffer dogs .  Romone Marshalleck was waiting to sell the guns on to the criminal underworld  Evidence from the seized phones of Loveless and Dyce showed fellow soldiers Duran Wright , 28 , and Lance Laurent , 26 , were also involved .  Laurent , also from the Queen 's Royal Hussars , had supplied Dyce with the car to carry the illicit stash , while Wright , from the Royal Logistic Corps , was instrumental in planning the operation .  Laurent and Dyce , both serving soldiers based in Germany , were arrested in March last year and charged on June 7 after flying back to the UK .

Ms Stronach said she was left ` angry ' and ` humiliated ' after bosses told her her body art - a celebration of her three children - would offend older patrons at the traditional department store .

They should just get over it and get in the real world . I was just shocked . They would n't even let me wear long sleeves because they said it was unhygienic , even though I wore them until they got me a uniform .  ' I was in long sleeves for the first two weeks and then I got my short sleeve shirt in the third week and that 's when it all happened .  ' I went there to do a job , which I did well as I always do I told the boss of the kitchen , who said it would n't matter as long as they are not offensive .  ` Everything happens for a reason ' : Ms Stronach 's tattoos celebrate her family  ` She said `` I 've got one on my foot , I do n't care '' .  ` There was another girl who worked there who had visible tattoo on her leg .  ` The store just never moved with the times and I could feel people watching me , ' said Ms Stronach , who added that she felt people were ` looking down on me and being judgemental ' when she was told to leave .

99	The extraordinary number of foreign criminals hiding in Britain was dramatically revealed yesterday after police arrested more than 700 suspects travelling on our roads in just 48 hours .  As a row raged over a report which showed the # 1billion-a-year failure of successive governments to guard Britain 's borders , police launched the biggest-ever blitz on overseas offenders , rounding up 1,687 suspects in two days .  Using number plate recognition technology to spot foreign-registered vehicles potentially associated with criminal activity , police stopped 2,304 cars , arresting 729 immigrants .  They include gangsters and thugs wanted in their own countries for crimes such as human trafficking , robbery , fraud , drug smuggling , assault and domestic abuse .  Scroll down for video  Police officers bash down a door as they conduct a raid on a property in Coventry yesterday  Raids across Britain in the past two days have netted more than 700 foreign criminals  One 28-year-old Czech fugitive wanted on a European Arrest Warrant  EAW  for 23 offences , including robbery , was spotted in Birmingham city centre .  The automatic number plate recognition cameras also identified a 51-year-old Polish man in Smethwick , West Midlands , who is suspected of a # 11,500 fraud . The week-long crackdown -- involving 43 forces in England and Wales -- has seen raids carried out targeting foreign criminals across the UK .  Police also handed out 958 fines and cautions to overseas motorists for driving without a licence , insurance or tax and using rebated fuel , known as red diesel .  West Midlands Police , which is co-ordinating Operation Trivium , gathered intelligence from 14 countries on their most wanted offenders in Britain . A list of 3,500 number plates associated with crime was distributed to traffic officers , who were instructed to pull over any matching vehicles . Meanwhile , 30 police officers from 14 European countries ran checks on the drivers on their own databases at a Birmingham control centre .  A 24-year-old Polish man was arrested in Worcester just hours after an EAW was authorised for crimes including domestic abuse , assault and theft in his homeland .  Suspected robbers , fraudsters and drug traffickers were all caught in the police raids  Police found another wanted man from Slovakia living in Handsworth , where he was running a human trafficking ring . In some cases , the offenders could be deported within ten days if they do not oppose extradition on an EAW .  Others arrested for crimes committed in the UK could face trial in Britain , where a judge will decide whether they should be deported at the end of their sentence .  Officers said the ` show of strength ' had yielded an unprecedented number of arrests by turning Birmingham into ` the headquarters for a European Union police force ' .  The crackdown came as ministers refused to name dozens of high-risk foreign criminals on the run for more than five years .  A damning National Audit Office report has revealed that foreign offenders are able to walk into the country unchecked , commit new offences , then cheat removal on human rights grounds once their jail terms are complete .  It claimed that 58 ` high harm ' offenders -- a category including rapists , killers and drug dealers -- absconded after being released from prison . One in six of the 4,200 foreign criminals freed from jail have fled , and police routinely fail to check if arrested foreign nationals have a criminal record at home .  The report prompted Paul Houston , whose daughter Amy was run over and killed by an illegal immigrant in 2003 , to accuse politicians of having ` blood on their hands ' .  But yesterday David Cameron stressed that 22,000 foreign national offenders had been removed from Britain since he entered Downing Street , adding : ` We 're making progress , the buck does stop with me but I would n't mind a bit of cross-party support for the actions we need to take .

100	By James Chapman  Ukip is to up the stakes in its controversial anti-immigration campaign for the European elections as the Tories insist only they can give voters a say on Britain 's future in the EU .  Ukip leader Nigel Farage will dismiss criticism by some Labour MPs that its key messages are ` racist ' - unveiling another provocative poster focusing on migration from the EU .  Featuring an escalator running up the White Cliffs of Dover , it claims the EU 's free movement rules means Britain has ` no border ' and ` no control ' over incomers .  Scroll down for video  Upped the stakes : Ukip 's latest poster for the election campaign has taken aim at the controversial change of legislation in January this year which opened Britain 's borders to immigrants from Eastern Europe  ` This is in my view the most powerful image of the entire European election campaign . It is designed to bring home to the British public just what membership of the EU means as regards controlling our own borders , ' the Ukip leader said .  ` The White Cliffs of Dover have always been seen as symbolic of Britain 's island status . That status should give us added ability to pick and choose the people who come to live and work in our country . But under EU free movement laws we have no serious control whatever .  ` No doubt the political establishment will react again in mock outrage and throw a new round of slurs and smears at UKIP and at me .  ` We 've been called every name under the sun in recent weeks . But we will not be silenced , and we know that millions of decent British people are on our side and are grateful that we are speaking out . '  Paul Sykes , a millionaire Yorkshire businessman is funding a # 1.5 million publicity campaign for Ukip in the European elections , said : ` This poster goes to the heart of the European debate .  Nigel Farage claims the image is the most powerful yet in the European debate ahead of the May 22 vote  ` Over the past 20 years or more , politicians - Conservative , Labour and Liberal Democrat - have conspired to hide the truth about EU immigration from the British public .  ` They have taken down our borders and handed over control of who who enters the UK to the Eurocrats in Brussels . '  David Cameron will use his local election campaign launch , taking place today in the West Midlands , to make a direct attack on Ukip -- warning voters that backing the upstart party will reduce their chances of having a say in a referendum .  The Conservatives will unveil their own poster , showing a referendum ballot-box marked ` Europe : You Decide ' alongside the words : ` An In-Out Referendum on Europe . Labour and the Lib Dems wo n't . Ukip ca n't . We will in 2017 . '  Seeking to address scepticism over his pledge , Mr Cameron will say : ` To those people who say you wo n't deliver that renegotiation or referendum , I say : Judge me by my record as prime minister .  ` Others talk about acting in the national interest or standing up to Europe , I do it , time and again - often In the teeth of opposition in Brussels and with a backdrop of uncertainty about whether it can really happen at home .  ` People said I would never veto a European treaty . In 2011 that 's exactly what I did . People said my attempts to cut the European budget would fail . But I secured that cut .  ` People said I could n't get Britain out of the eurozone bailout scheme which Labour got us into , but I did just that . And now , we 're not liable to pay for any Eurozone country that needs a bail-out .  ` So I have a track record of delivery - and I believe me , whatever it takes , I will deliver this in-out referendum . Labour wo n't . UKIP ca n't . I will .  David Cameron 's approach to the issue is a ` You Decide ' campaign . Ed Miliband 's party has attacked Ukip 's ` xenophobia ' and ` lies '  ` I would not be Prime Minister of a government unless we could carry out our pledge of an in-out referendum . Because the British people deserve their say . And I will make sure they get it . '  Labour 's former European Parliament leader said voters considering backing Ukip needed to be ` educated ' about its ` lies ' and ` xenophobia ' .

101	By Alex Greig  PUBLISHED :   08:39 EST , 25 October 2013   | UPDATED :   09:49 EST , 25 October 2013  A North Carolina county precinct Republican chair has resigned after a controversial interview that aired on ` The Daily Show ' Wednesday night .  A spokesman for the Buncombe County Republican Party confirmed that the resignation was directly related to the interview , in which Yelton said , among other things , ` lazy black people ' want ` the government to give them everything . '  Interviewer Aasif Mandvi interviewed Yelton about North Carolina 's new voter ID law , which has been contested by the Justice Department .  SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO  Cringeworthy : Republican Don Yelton made comments to Daily Show correspondent Aasif Mandvi that prompted the latter to remark , ` You know we can hear you , right ? '  The state contends that the law , which requires voters to show certain specified forms of photo ID in order to be allowed to vote , is intended to limit minority voters .  Yelton demurred , saying the law would prevent voter fraud , a crime committed , by his own admission , by possibly one or two people per year .  ` The bottom line is , the law is not racist , ' stated Yelton .  ` Of course the law is not racist . And you 're not racist , ' suggests Mandvi , a statement which is greeted by a long pause from Yelton .  ` Well , ' he says . ' I have been called a bigot before . '  Resigned : North Carolina county precinct GOP chair Yelton resigned on Thursday after the offensive interview aired  He goes on to tell Mandvi that in fact , one of his best friends is black .  The segment then becomes a montage of cringe-worthy statements from Yelton , including :  ` When I was a young man , you did n't call a black a black , you called him a negro . '  ' I had a picture one time of Obama sitting on a stump as a witch doctor , I posted that one Facebook ... I was making fun of the white half of Obama , not the black half . '  ` And now , you have a black person using the term , ` n ***** this , n ****** that , ' and it 's OK for them to do it . '  This last comment prompts Mandvi to ask Yelton , ` You know we can hear you , right ? '  Yelton goes on to explain that in fact , the voter ID law in North Carolina would affect mostly Democrat voters , effectively admitting that the law suppresses Democrat votes .  ` If it hurts the whites , so be it , ' he says . ` If it hurts a bunch of lazy blacks that want the government to give them everything , so be it . '  Yelton 's Facebook feed is equally unbecoming to a person in the public eye , proving he 's never been one to mince his words - or even spell them correctly .  Facebook faux pas : Yelton 's Facebook feed is as uncensored as his Daily Show interview  Pushed out : The GOP says it does not support Yelton 's views or comments  According to Business Insider , the Buncombe County GOP said in a statement that Yelton was ` recently reprimanded and removed from his position as a precinct chair . '  He had been re-elected to the position at the 2013 convention by a margin of two votes - his own and his wife 's .  ` Mr Yelton 's comments are offensive , uniformed , and unacceptable of any member within the Republican Party , ' the statement read .  ` In no way are his comments representative of the local or state Republican Party .

104	By Glen Owen  PUBLISHED :  20:07 EST , 12 January 2013   |  UPDATED :  02:53 EST , 14 January 2013  Ed Miliband was last night accused of trying to cover up a donation from a controversial banker who has faced calls to be stripped of his knighthood .  Sir Victor Blank -- the former Lloyds TSB chairman blamed by shareholders for the bank 's humiliating # 21 billion taxpayer bailout -- gave # 10,000 to Labour just days after Mr Miliband made a major speech attacking bankers ' behaviour .  Sir Victor paid the money by bidding at a Labour fundraising auction for a set of handwritten team talk notes by Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson .  The # 10k donation : Former Lloyds TSB chairman Sir Victor Blank , left , paid # 10,000 for handwritten team talk notes by Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson , pictured right , at a Labour fundraising auction  The notes , prepared for the 2011 Champions League Final against Barcelona , had been secured by Tony Blair 's former spin chief Alastair Campbell , who is a friend of Sir Alex.  Sir Victor did not attend the auction in July but used a proxy bidder to buy the lot for # 10,000 . The Labour Party recorded the bid in its donations register -- but said that it had come from Rothschild bank .  Last night a Conservative MP called on the Electoral Commission to investigate whether Labour leader Mr Miliband had attempted to cover up Sir Victor 's donation .  Under Electoral Commission rules , all such successful bids have to be included on the public register of donations .  Labour declared the donation -- from ` Rothschild Private Banking ' -- on July 25 , two weeks after Mr Miliband had given a speech in which he attacked the behaviour of financiers and pledged ` to build banks that serve the people , not just themselves ' .  Investigation : A Tory MP has called for the Electoral Commission to investigate whether Ed Miliband attempted to ` cover-up the donation ' after it was registered as being from ` Rothschild Private Banking '  Sir Victor incurred the wrath of Lloyds shareholders when he agreed to Gordon Brown 's request to save the ailing Halifax Bank of Scotland  HBOS  by mounting a takeover in September 2008 .  The former Prime Minister -- who made the suggestion at a drinks reception which has subsequently been dubbed ` the most expensive cocktail party in history ' -- said that competition rules would be relaxed to allow the deal to be rushed through .  Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen has written to the Electoral Commission over why the donations was ` misregistered '  Disastrously , shares in the newly formed Lloyds Banking Group soon plunged by 90 per cent .  The Financial Services Authority  FSA  is now investigating the circumstances behind the merger and is expected to report in the spring .  Last year , activists representing 800,000 Lloyds shareholders joined MPs in calling for Sir Victor to be stripped of his knighthood if he is censured by the FSA .  Their demands came after Fred Goodwin , the former boss of the Royal Bank of Scotland , saw his knighthood forfeited for his role in the bank 's near collapse , a move backed by Mr Miliband .  Last night Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said he had written to the Electoral Commission to ask why the donation had been misregistered . In his letter , Mr Bridgen says ` the public will want to be assured that the Labour Party did not purposefully cover up his donation to avoid negative media coverage ' .  He told The Mail on Sunday : ` It beggars belief that Labour -- whose failure to regulate the banks helped cause the biggest bust ever -- are now taking cash from the man who broke Lloyds , leading to a multi - billion-pound taxpayer-funded bank bailout . By either reckless incompetence or deliberate misrepresentation Labour hid the fact that Sir Victor Blank gave Ed Miliband 's Labour Party thousands of pounds last summer .  ` Which failed banker will Labour be taking money from next -- Fred Goodwin ? '  A source close to Sir Victor said that the ex-banker had bid for the team talk because he was a keen collector of sporting memorabilia . ` Someone bid on his behalf , and the cheque was sent by Rothschild because the bank manages his private trust . That is clearly why the mistake happened . '  A Labour Party spokesman said : ` This was an administrative error by the Labour Party which we have already corrected with the Electoral Commission , ' adding that it was now recorded as a personal donation by Sir Victor .

105	Squadron Leader Ronald Fairfax Hamlyn shot down five enemy planes during three missions in a single day during the Battle of Britain in August 1940  The remarkable story of an RAF hero who achieved ` ace ' status in a single day of flying has come to light after his medals were put up for sale .  Squadron Leader Ronald Fairfax Hamlyn - known as the ` Pied Piper of Harrogate ' - shot down five enemy planes during three missions in a single day during the Battle of Britain .  On the first occasion he shot down a Junkers 88 bomber in his Spitfire followed by a Messerschmitt 109  Me109  off the Kent coast .  Records show how he took off again at 11.35 am and chased another Me109 across the English Channel before taking it down over Calais .  He then achieved his fourth and fifth hits after lunch with two more Me109s off the Isle of Sheppey .  His log book shows the three separate flights lasted just three and a half hours .  Within days Squadron Leader Hamlyn was invited on to the BBC to broadcast his account of ` Bringing Down Five German Bombers ' to the nation .  In all , the airman claimed 11 kills during the Battle of Britain , with eight in only six days in August 1940 .  His exploits helped repel Adolf Hitler 's plans to invade Britain .  The failure of Germany to achieve its objectives of destroying Britain 's air defences , or forcing Britain to negotiate an armistice or even an outright surrender , is considered its first major defeat and a crucial turning point in the Second World War .

On his first flight of the day , lasting an hour and ten minutes , he shot down a Junkers 88 bomber followed by a Messerschmitt 109 off the Kent coast .  He then returned to the mess at Biggin Hill , in south east London , for breakfast .  He took off again at 11.35 am and was soon in action , chasing another Me109 across the English Channel and taking it down over Calais .  He then returned for lunch in the mess shortly after 1pm following an hour and 35 minutes of flying .  After lunch he returned to the skies , this time achieving his fourth and fifth ` kills ' - two Me109s off the Isle of Sheppey . His final mission lasted just 45 minutes .  Squadron Leader Hamlyn was personally commended by Winston Churchill for his exploits and was awarded the prestigious Distinguished Flying Cross  DFC  for the ` ace in a day ' feat .  He went on to fly Hurricanes and sink German shipping in the North Sea and the English Channel before being posted to an air sea rescue squadron which helped recover more than 60 men from the sea .  His impressive medal group , including the DFC and the Air Force Cross , is now being sold at auction for an estimated # 60,000 .  They have been owned by a private collector for more than 15 years . The medals are being sold with his log book , which includes his own drawings of German aircraft and shipping he had destroyed .  Oliver Pepys , of auctioneers Spinks of London , said : ` As far as we are aware there were only two British airmen in the Second World War who achieved ace in a day status , Ronald Hamlyn was one of them .  ` It is a very distinguished but very rare list .

106	Stewart Parnell , of Peanut Corporation of America , was found guilty in Georgia federal court  The head of a peanut company that distributed salmonella-tainted peanuts that sickened hundreds of people across the U.S. five years ago has been convicted of conspiracy and other charges .  Former Peanut Corporation of America owner Stewart Parnell was found guilty Friday during a federal trial in Albany , Georgia .  Parnell , his brother , Michael Parnell , and quality assurance manager Mary Wilkerson have been on trial since August 1 on federal charges stemming from a salmonella outbreak in 2008 and 2009 that sickened 714 and was linked to nine deaths .  Michael Parnell was also found guilty of conspiracy .  The brothers are charged with knowingly shipping contaminated peanut butter to customers and faking lab tests intended to screen for salmonella . Tainted peanut butter from the company 's plant in rural Blakely , Georgia , ended up in jars , packaged crackers and other snacks .  The outbreak led to one of the largest food recalls in U.S. history .  The peanut plant 's quality control manager , Mary Wilkerson , is charged along with Stewart Parnell with obstructing justice . Experts say it is the first time food processors have been tried in a federal food-poisoning case .  The Peanut Corp. of America was shut down after a massive salmonella outbreak was traced back to its peanut butter plant in Georgia  There was testimony at the trial that people got sick . But attorneys and witnesses never mentioned any of the people who died because the Parnell brothers are n't charged with killing or sickening anybody .  Medical tests confirmed people who ate peanut butter from the Georgia plant were sickened by salmonella . It 's harder to be sure salmonella killed some of them .  Instead , prosecutors decided they could build a stronger case charging them with defrauding their customers -- food producers including Kellogg 's -- and selling them tainted goods , said U.S. Attorney Michael Moore of Georgia 's Middle District , whose office tried the case .  ` We wanted to make sure we kept the jury focused on the conduct that led to these people 's sickness , but not let the case get into the medical history of every victim out there ' with testimony on individual deaths , Moore said .  Defense attorneys have acknowledged the Georgia plant shipped tainted peanut butter and covered up positive salmonella tests , but they say the scheme was carried out behind the backs of the Parnell brothers by two plant managers who pleaded guilty .  The three defendants , charged with 71 total counts , still face severe punishment if convicted .  Prosecutors have said Stewart Parnell faces a maximum of 754 years in prison and $ 17 million in fines . And Moore said he intends to present evidence of the deaths during sentencing if there are convictions .  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which tracked the outbreak from victims back to the plant , determined 714 people got sick in 43 U.S. states .  Three deaths were reported in Minnesota , two in Ohio , two in Virginia , one in Idaho and one in North Carolina . But the CDC hedged when tying fatalities to salmonella .  ` The nine deaths reported are linked to the Salmonella Typhimurium outbreak , but were not definitively caused by Salmonella , ' the CDC said in a May 2009 report .  Marler said all nine who died tended to be older people with other problems that made them vulnerable to severe effects from food poisoning .  ` They have cancer , they have diabetes , they have heart disease and their immune systems are compromised , ' Marler said . ` There 's no question they were infected . It 's really about what prompted their deaths .

107	By David Martosko , U.s. Political Editor  PUBLISHED :   12:51 EST , 4 March 2014    | UPDATED :   14:47 EST , 4 March 2014  Much of President Obama 's 2015 budget proposal wo n't get through the Republican-controlled House of Representatives , but the White House has unveiled it anyway -- a liberal Democratic wish list of policies , many of which the GOP has already nixed or refused to take up .  The White House said Tuesday that the president 's budget , all $ 3.901 trillion of it , would fully fund Obamacare , raise the national minimum wage to $ 10.10 per hour and index it to inflation , vastly expand infrastructure-repair plans that benefit labor unions , and significantly reduces the size of the U.S. standing army .  House Republicans will object to these and other measures , but the Democrat-controlled Senate has the first hearings on the budget , scheduled for Wednesday morning . White House Budget Office director Sylvia Mathews Burwell will testify .  The budget blueprint claims that $ 402 billion in savings related to the Affordable Care Act will offset new spending . That number is based on last year 's budget , which called deep cuts to Medicare , trimming more than $ 300 billion from provider payments and another $ 50 billion from senior citizens .  Scroll down for video  Going it alone ? Obama spoke about his FY2015 budget at a Washington , DC elementary school , looking isolated on a carpet decorated with cartoonish drawings of the alphabet  The opposition : House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan  L  , House Majority Leader Eric Cantor  C  and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp  R  will be waiting with knives out when Obama 's ambitious budget hits Capitol Hill  But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office declared in February that the overall cost of the Obamacare law would eclipse $ 2 trillion over ten years , erasing much of that savings .  Obama presented his budget during a photo-op at a Washington , D.C. school , emphasizing education initiatives that were largely lost in the static about larger spending numbers .  Republicans are already complaining .  The budget proposal ` would hollow out our defense capabilities . And it would do nothing to preserve or strengthen our entitlements , ' House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan , a Wisconsin Republican , said in a statement .  Obama 's budget restores cuts in Social Security payments that he offered Republicans just a few months ago as an enticement to reaching the eventual budget deal in December .  ` The president has just three years left in his administration , and yet he seems determined to do nothing about our fiscal challenges , ' said Ryan . ` This budget is n't a serious document ; it 's a campaign brochure . '  ` It would demand that families pay more so Washington can spend more , ' he added .  But the details reveal a proposal that will cut the tax burdens of some families -- with a $ 60 billion expansion of the poverty-fighting Earned Income Tax Credit , for instance -- while hiking costs for the wealthy and big corporations that create jobs .  Obama played with schoolchildren after addressing an ambitious $ 3.9 trillion budget proposal  And the president wants to spend an additional $ 56 billion for new stimulus projects and $ 302 billion on infrastructure repairs over four years -- pleasing labor unions , a major Democratic constituency .  Ryan and House Republicans are expected to release their own budget proposal in April , starting the inevitable back-and-forth sniping that will likely culminate in a fiscal showdown just before the November midterm elections .  Wisconsin Republican Rep. Paul Ryan , the GOP 's vice presidential candidate in 2012 , has emerged as the budget negotiator for Speaker John Boehner , but some tea party-aligned members of Congress fear that he will give too much away to the Democrat-controlled Senate  Republicans are ` counting on building the tension up to a breaking point , ' a GOP election strategist in North Carolina told MailOnline on Tuesday . ` They 're betting that jobs , the economy and Obamacare will look so bad by November that the Senate Democrats will do just about anything to save their own skins . '  The GOP needs to capture just six seats in the U.S. Senate this year in order to retake the majority and control both houses of Congress . Vulnerable Democratic incumbents in at least five states have said they do n't intend to campaign for re-election with President Obama by their side .  Obama 's proposal , Rep. Ryan 's office said , would add $ 8.3 trillion to the national debt in the long-term and raise $ 1.8 trillion in new tax revenue .  That includes the so-called ` Buffett Rule ' tax which Obama has championed . That measure , according to the White House , would ` require that millionaires pay no less than 30 percent of income -- after charitable contributions ' in federal income taxes .  Another hit to the wealthiest Americans will come in the elimination of a specialized ` carried interest ' provision in the federal tax code . That item allows private fund managers on Wall Street to cut their income tax rates for most of what they earn .  Americans for Prosperity , a tea party-backed conservative group , said Obama 's budget proposal is ` not a serious attempt to solve our nation 's fiscal problems . '  Tim Phillips , the group 's president , added that ` once again , President Obama has produced a budget that does n't balance , runs annual deficits , and relies on partisan politics , instead of a fiscally responsible , pro-growth tax policy . '  	  Wish list is likely dead-on-arrival in the GOP-controlled House of Representatives    It would formalize a national minimum wage hike while enforcing the ` Buffett Rule ' that sets minimum actual income tax levels for millionaires    Obama has eliminated cuts to Social Security that he promised as part of last year 's budget negotiation    He also wants more than $ 300 billion in infrastructure improvements , helping labor unions in an election year    Paul Ryan , the House Budget Committee chairman , slammed the White House budget , saying it 's a ` campaign brochure , ' not a practical list	By David Martosko , U.s.

108	An auction house has provoked fury in the Jewish community after it sold Nazi memorabilia on the holiest day in the Jewish calendar .  J.P. Humbert Auctioneers sold flags emblazoned with swastikas and Hitler Youth armbands on September 25 , as Jews observed Yom Kippur .  The Northamptonshire auction house has since admitted the timing of the sale was ` unfortunate ' and tried to donate an undisclosed amount to a Holocaust charity , which refused the offer .  Auctioneer Jonathan Humbert  seen right  , admitted the timing of the sale had been ` unfortunate '  The Holocaust Educational Trust refused the donation on the grounds they do n't take money from the sale of items associated with the Nazi regime .  A spokesperson for the charity said : ` The Holocaust Educational Trust will not accept any donations from organisations which profit from the sale of items associated with the Nazi regime .  ` It is our view that these items are best placed in archives , museums or in an educational context . '  Mr Humbert defended the auction house , based in Towcester , Northants , and said yesterday : ` Not being Jewish , how am I expected to know the dates of Jewish festivals ?  ` The sum we offered was not the proceeds of any specific sale , it would have been a bona fide ex-gratia donation .  ` They refused it because it was against their policy . '  ` It 's not my place to make moral judgements ' : Items going under the hammer included Hitler Youth armbands and an SS bayonet  The sale included a wide range of Nazi memorabilia , including an SS bayonet , Hitler Youth armbands , a range of swastika flags and SS crockery .  Recent collections of Nazi photos , cutlery from the Buchenwald concentration camp and cuffs belonging to the Totenkopf , an SS division originally formed from concentration camp guards , were also included in the sale .  Although against the law in some European countries , including France and Germany , the sale of Nazi memorabilia is legal in the UK .  Mr Humbert added : ` If the law changes we will abide by it to the letter . But we do not actively court Nazi items and it is not for me to make a moral judgement .  Jonathan Humbert defended the auction house in Towcester , Northamptonshire , which he said handles items ` sensitively and sensibly '  ` We 've sold a sofa and other things associated with Winston Churchill and he ordered the bombing of Dresden where tens of thousands of people died , yet we did n't have people saying those sales were disgusting .  ` We do handle items sensitively and sensibly , and in no way do we wish to glorify the Nazi regime .  ` This time , I have turned away items that I do not wish to be associated with : namely a cosh used at Bergen Belsen and a book entitled ` Covenant with Death ' with horrific photos .  ` As an auctioneer , it is not my place to make moral judgements , but part of what we do is to keep alive the worst element in human nature .  ` If you keep these things alive in people 's consciousness - and do n't bury them - we can hope the terrible things will never happen again . ` No one is glorifying the SS or the Holocaust - far from it .

109	Triple Olympic champion Jason Kenny admits he has had to bulk up to keep pace with the changing dynamics of the men 's sprint .

Improve : Jason Kenny  right  has had to bulk up to keep pace with the changing dynamics of men  All of the men who finished above him there were heavier , more powerful riders than Kenny .  Having failed to beat them in Colombia , Kenny 's next plan is to join them by tipping the scales when he rides for Team England at next week 's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow .  ' I was fifth at the Worlds and everyone in front of me was bigger , the average was probably 10 kilos more than me , ' he said .  ' A lot of big guys are winning races now so I have to kind of step up and match that .  ` I 've had to gain a bit of weight and strength because the landscape 's changing a bit in sprint racing .  ` Since the World Championships I 've gained four kilos and that does n't sound a lot but it is for me because I 'm really consistent with my weight .  ` Right now is the heaviest I 've ever been but you have to gain useful weight . You do put a bit of chub on , it 's impossible not too , but I try and overshoot then come back down again . '  Kenny and girlfriend Laura Trott , who also hopes to be among the medals for Team England , made some waves in recent weeks for suggesting the Commonwealth Games did not feature too high on their agendas .  Ready : Kenny takes part in a Team England training session ahead of the 2014 Commonwealth Games  He does not deny that remains the case , but is warming to the task ahead of him - as well as the chance to complete a hat-trick of Olympic , World and Commonwealth titles .  ' I always try to be honest . Laura and I were honest when we said the programme was n't funded for the Commonwealths , it 's funded for the Olympics .  ` Individually we 're funded for the Olympics too and that 's just the truth .  ` When you look at the programme sat in an office or at a team meeting that 's all that matters , but when you start training and put the fast wheels on these things get a bit more serious and come race day this will be really important .  ` Ideally I 'd like to compete the set with Commonwealth gold because that would be the three major championships - Olympics , Worlds and Commies for me .

110	By John Stevens For Daily Mail  David Cameron has accused the First Minister of ` desperate ' tactics over his claim that separation will protect the NHS from privatisation .  The Prime Minister stressed health is devolved to Holyrood and controversial changes at Westminster can not be imposed on Scots .  Alex Salmond , who went green bowling in Arbroath with Scotland 's Commonwealth medallists today , has argued that NHS budget cuts south of the border would be replicated in Scotland -- despite the fact Holyrood has received an extra # 1.3 billion from Westminster over five years .  First Minister Alex Salmond visits Abbey Bowling Club in Arbroath , where he played a game of bowls with Commonwealth Bowling gold medalist Darren Burnett and Sport Minister Shona Robison  Mr Salmond celebrated his first attempt at bowling - but it later emerged that he had been practising beforehand  He has persisted with the argument despite claims of hypocrisy after it emerged the Scottish Government 's own spending on private contractors rose by almost a quarter last year to more than # 80million .  Mr Cameron said : ` Health is a devolved issue . So the only person who could , if they wanted to , introduce more private provision into the NHS in Scotland is Alex Salmond .  ` I think this is a desperate man recognising the argument is going away from him making a pretty desperate argument .  ` Actually because of the protection on NHS spending that the UK Government has given that we would not cut NHS spending while we have had to make difficult decisions elsewhere - that has actually made sure under the Barnett formula that money is available for Scotland as well .  ` So I think that argument does not stack up at all . '  Mr Salmond has even claimed he would legally protect Scotland 's NHS from privatisation in the constitution in an attempt to woo left wing voters .  And the pro-independence Yes Scotland campaign say the message is winning over voters on the doorsteps .  Campaigning in Glasgow yesterday , chief executive Blair Jenkins said : ` There are real threats and risks if we stay in the UK .  ` People in Scotland are really waking up to the extent to which the NHS in England is being privatised , that 's coming up a lot .  ` People know if we stay in the UK the austerity agenda , the pressure on public services , budget cuts , and all of that will continue .  ` There 's no doubt this is touching a real emotional nerve with people , particularly women . They can see there is a really strong argument on that front for voting for independence . '  The Prime Minister attacked Mr Salmond 's claim that the NHS would be safer from privatisation after independence  First Minister Alex Salmond and the Scottish Cabinet hold the last Cabinet meeting before the referendum on Scottish independence next month  Scottish spending on private sector healthcare rose by 37 per cent in the first five years after the SNP came to power in 2007 .  In 2012/13 , the most recent Audit Scotland figures available , private spending had reached more than # 80million -- that was 23 per cent higher than the previous year alone .  Unaudited figures for 2013/14 show a slight dip to # 79million , but is still far higher than all previous years .  Mr Salmond has argued privatisation south of the border will lead to a cut . In fact , the budget for England 's NHS is expected to increase from # 105.6 billion in 2013-14 , to # 110.4 billion in 2015-16 .

113	By Nadia Gilani  Last updated at 11:23 AM on 4th January 2012  The owner of a ferocious dog that mauled a woman to death after being kept in a tiny cage walked free from court after a judge said his actions did not deserve a jail term .  Alex Blackburn-Smith , 34 , admitted failing to ensure the welfare of his two-and-a-half-year-old Neapolitan mastiff Debo - likened to a hound from the Harry Potter films - but was told his behaviour had not ` passed the custody threshold ' .  The former paratrooper kept the eight-stone beast cooped up in close quarters in the weeks before it mauled 52-year-old Barbara Williams , Croydon Magistrates ' Court heard .  Alex Blackburn-Smith arrives at Croydon Magistrates Court to be sentenced  She died after she was savaged by the animal at Blackburn-Smith 's home in Wallington , Surrey on December 23 , 2010 .  He was originally arrested on suspicion of manslaughter but later admitted failing to ensure the welfare of the animal .  Blackburn-Smith kept Debo in a cage that was too small , which could have caused the dog to become violent , the court was told yesterday .  But RSPCA officers and a police community support officer failed to notice this when they visited Blackburn-Smith 's home regarding a separate noise complaint prior to the attack on Ms Williams .  Debo , described as ` ferocious ' and ` distinctly large ' by police , was shot dead by armed marksmen , who contained the snarling animal using riot shields after the attack .  Debo was a Neapolitan mastiff similar to the one pictured  Blackburn-Smith also admitted being in possession of a fighting dog after police also seized a cross/pitbull puppy called Ruby .  At the time of the attack , three other people and a child were also living in the property , the court heard .  Police were called to Blackburn-Smith 's home at 8.57 pm on December 23 , said Angela Williams , prosecuting .  ` They discovered a female with severe injuries lying in the hallway . She was subsequently pronounced dead at the scene , ' she said .  ` The Neapolitan mastiff was located , isolated and destroyed .  ` The pitbull puppy was also seized . '  One witness told how Ms Williams and another woman were upstairs watching TV then went to the kitchen , where the two dogs were kept in cages .  Debo was heard to growl then told to be quiet , the court heard , but the dog managed to force the cage open and attack the victim .  Richard Jeffries , defending , said : ` It 's clear the two charges relate to different dogs . Ruby was Debo 's daughter .  ` No one knows what set Debo off , police carried out an inquiry and the defendant was initially arrested on suspicion of manslaughter . '  It was only after a full inquiry that he was charged with the two offences for which he appeared in court .  Mr Jeffries said : ` Keeping Debo in the cage may have been a contributing factor .  ` Debo was bought as a family pet and was the same style of dog as you might see in the Harry Potter films .  The lawyer defending Blackburn-Smith likened Debo to Fang - Hagrid 's dog in the Harry Potter Films - pictured with actor Robbie Coltrane  ` Barbara Williams was more than a lodger , she was perceived as an auntie .  ` Nothing I say can diminish the tragedy that occurred and that is something my client has to live with every day . '  Blackburn-Smith was banned from owning any animal and having anything to do with keeping or transporting animals at an earlier hearing .

114	Tom Huddlestone has urged Hull City to sign Arsenal 's striker Yaya Sanogo on loan as boss Steve Bruce admitted the Tigers ' defence struggled to cope with the powerful young Frenchman in the FA Cup final .  Bruce has been in contact with Arsene Wenger about a loan move - but there are rival clubs interested too .  Midfielder Huddlestone said : ' I was speaking to a couple of the lads yesterday when we heard the rumour and they were saying he 's a handful .  Arsenal striker Yaya Sanogo  right  celebrates after scoring against Dortmund in the Champions League  Hull City midfielder Tom Huddlestone has praised Sanogo , calling him an ` intelligent footballer '  ` He 's an intelligent footballer for one so young . The times I 've seen him at Arsenal , I think he 's done very well .  ` He 's been a bit unlucky at Arsenal in front of goal and at the highest level , which Arsenal is , you probably need to be a bit more clinical but football-wise he 's done well . He 's impressed me . '  Sanogo grabbed his first competitive goal in the Champions League against Borussia Dortmund but he has yet to score in the league in 11 appearances for Arsenal .  That lack of goals has not put off Bruce , who is also aware of his two goals as France Under-21s came back to beat England 3-2 in November .  Bruce said : ` To be fair to him , how many times has he played ? It 's always very difficult coming on as sub .  Tigers boss Steve Bruce has also admitted that he has been impressed by the Frenchman  Sanogo battles for the ball with Bayern Munich captain Philipp Lahm last season at the Emirates Stadium  ' I do n't know how many starts he 's had but he played against us in the cup final and I was very impressed with him . I saw him play for Arsenal against Dortmund in the Champions League as well .  ` For the French under-21s he 's been nothing short of fantastic .

Seven other youngsters were also injured in the blast on the outskirts of the city of Gujrat . Five of them were in serious condition in hospital .  Twenty-four children , aged between five and 15 , were being taken to a private school when the vehicle caught fire , local police chief Dar Ali Khattak told AFP .  Wounded : One of the officers hurt in a suspected militant attack on a police convoy 12 miles from the city of Peshawar  Victim : The body of a police officer killed in the clash with suspected militants lies on a hospital trolly as his colleagues attend to him  He added : ` The fire erupted in the vehicle when the children were only a few kilometres from their school .  The blaze was apparently caused by a spark when the driver of the dual-fuel van switched from gas to petrol , he added .  The driver survived the explosion 120 miles southeast of the capital Islamabad , by fleeing the fire .  Many vehicles in Pakistan are powered by relatively cheap compressed natural gas and cylinder blasts are common .  Vulnerable : Explosions are common on gas-powered vehicles in Pakistan  The accident comes after two suspected militant attacks left nine people dead in two different areas of northwest Pakistan on Friday .  Suspected militants armed with heavy weapons attacked a police convoy in Mattani , 12 miles south of the main northwest city of Peshawar , killing six officers and wounding seven others .  In the second attack , a suicide bomber walked up to a vehicle owned by an Afghan religious leader in Peshawar and set off his explosives , killing three people , said police officer Riaz Ali Shah .  The leader , Haji Hayatullah , was not harmed in the attack because he was in a nearby mosque attending prayers . Hayatullah 's driver and guard were killed , said Shah .  A passerby was also killed and two others were wounded ,  There are more than one million refugees in Pakistan from neighboring Afghanistan . No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks .

116	By Mario Ledwith  PUBLISHED :  21:11 EST , 29 December 2012   |  UPDATED :  21:11 EST , 29 December 2012  Outspoken : Archbishop Bernard Longley , writing in a letter to churches in his diocese , warns that plans to legalise gay marriage could tarnish the Christian view of family life  Plans to legalise gay marriage would undermine the Christian view of the family , according to a leading Roman Catholic archbishop .  The Archbishop of Birmingham Bernard Longley warned that the Government can not foresee the ` full consequences ' of the proposals .  In a letter to churches and chapels in his diocese , the Archbishop warned of the impact gay marriage would have on ` children involved or for wider society ' .  His warnings are the latest attack from a senior member of the Catholic Church on David Cameron 's plans to allow gay couples to marry in churches .  In the letter , due to be read to worshippers tomorrow , the Archbishop said : ` Government policy can not foresee the full consequences , for the children involved or for wider society , of being brought up by two mothers without a father 's influence or by two fathers without a mother 's influence .  ` We first learn about diversity and acquire a respect for difference through the complementarity of our parents . '  He describes the ` complementary love of father and mother ' as a ` precious gift that we should wish for every child ' .  Archbishop Longley adds : ` We know that many single parents courageously and generously look after their children and often struggle to give them a fine up-bringing .  ` If it had not been for the understanding of St Joseph , our Lady herself might have had to face the difficulties of being a single parent .  ` Even so , the experience of growing up with our father and mother to teach and guide , to console and love us unconditionally is an invaluable blessing in life . '  Views : In the letter the Archbishop describes the ` complementary love of father and mother ' as a ` precious gift that we should wish for every child '  Criticism : The archbishop said that the Government could not foresee the consequences for ` children or wider society '  The remarks follow the more pointed criticism from the Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols , the most senior Catholic in England and Wales .  He lambasted the Prime Minister for his ` undemocratic ' and ` Orwellian ' plans to legalise gay marriage .  The archbishop said the proposals were a ` shambles ' , and accused David Cameron of pushing through the changes without a mandate .  In his Christmas Eve sermon at Westminster Cathedral , he said that only marriage between a man and a woman shares in ` the creative love of God ' .  The Catholic Bishop of Shrewsbury , Mark Davies , also used his Christmas homily to liken moves to legalise same-sex marriage to the way Nazis and Communists tried to undermine religion .  Archbishop Nichols criticised successive governments for failing to stand up for marriage and promoting sex before marriage instead .  ` Shambles ' : The Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols said the plans to introduce same-sex marriage laws are undemocratic  In an interview with the BBC , he attacked parties who were promoting same-sex marriage , saying the plan was ` Orwellian ' because there was no mandate from the public .  ` From a democratic point of view , it 's a shambles , ' he said . ` George Orwell would be proud of the manoeuvre . I think the process is shambolic . '  The attacks from leading Catholics come despite the fact polls show the public is largely in favour of allowing gay couples to marry .  Civil partnerships - which come with most , but not all , of the legal safeguards of marriage - were introduced seven years ago .  They allow gay couples to celebrate their unions in civil settings , but not in religious buildings .  Now the Government wants to allow them to call their unions marriage and have the ceremony in civil and religious settings .  Opposition : The most senior Catholic in England and Wales described the plans as ` Orwellian '  Religious organisations such as the Quakers and the Unitarians have said they would like to be able to host gay marriages .  But the Church of England and Roman Catholic Church are against it and the legislation says it would be illegal for any Anglican vicar to marry a gay couple .  Ministers insist that churches will never be forced to carry out gay marriage , but opponents say homosexual couples could get the ban overturned under European human rights laws .  Pope Benedict XVI has also reiterated his opposition to gay marriage earlier this month , saying that it was destroying the very ` essence of the human creature ' .

Competition : Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos holds up the new Kindle Fire HD 7 '' and Kindle Fire HD 8.9 '' which is one of the iPad 's top competitors  Amazon did n't release a new version until late in the quarter , but it had nothing in the third quarter of 2011 because the Fire was n't released until last November , after the quarter ended .  Amazon managed a 9 per cent worldwide share even though the Fire was available only in the U.S. during the third quarter .

118	By James Nye  PUBLISHED :  15:07 EST , 26 September 2012   |  UPDATED :  11:04 EST , 19 October 2012  As a proud hunter who enjoys the outdoor lifestyle , Paul Ryan 's appeal to the base of the Republican Party is thought to have been one of the main reasons why Mitt Romney chose the self-styled action man for his presidential ticket .  So when the Wisconsin Congressman was photographed in Cincinnati yesterday buying his 10-year-old daughter camouflage gear for a hunting expedition this Fall to go along with the rifle he got her last Christmas , the outrage from liberal 's condemning the father-daughter trip was all too predictable .  But the backlash against father-of-three Ryan has been met with a remarkable counter-backlash from gun enthusiasts across the country who have taken to Twitter to post pictures of their little girls posing with rifles , automatic weapons and hand guns supporting the GOP politicians right to introduce his daughter to firearms .  Greg Hollinger 's daughter with a Second Amendment rifle  Gary Hollinger took to Twitter after Michelle Malkin tweeted in support of Paul Ryan shopping for hunting gear for his daughter  The small army of support began when Fox News contributor Michelle Malkin spoke up in favour of Ryan and tweeted that she had taken her 12-year daughter shooting for her birthday and that ` Self-defence is one of the best gifts you can give a girl . '  This invited hundreds of dads , mothers and supporters of the Second Amendment to come forward to share their memories and pictures of learning to shoot from their father or of teaching their girl to fire a gun .  One proud parent with the Twitter name @OffACough uploaded a picture of his 13-year-old daughter with her Remington 870 shotgun and the 20-pound turkey that she had just killed and that she was going to eat before heading off to the mall to buy some shoes .  Michelle Malkin 's tweet that started the whole backlash against the backlash is replied to by Randy Janinda who also tweeted his daughter at the shooting range on her 16th birthday  Randy Janinda 's daughter spent her 16th birthday at the firing range and tweeted this picture in support of Paul Ryan  Jeff Gill 's 12-year-old daughter still needs to work on her grip according to the tweet he posted supporting Paul Ryan  Some of the tweets from individuals were in defence of their constitutional rights , with Rob O'Donnell putting pictures on the social networking site of his two girls with semi-automatic weapons stating , ` it 's not only my right , but my duty to share and teach the love of shooting with my daughters . '  One father , Matt McCracken , decided to put a sweet picture of his little girl holding a rifle almost as tall as her onto Twitter , stating that ` this is my daughter age 10 learning gun safety . '  In addition to dads standing up for Paul Ryan , daughters got in on the act too .  Stephanie Janiczek tweeted , ` My Papa bought me my first shotgun , a Remington MDL 1100 with a full choke barrell when I was twelve . Got first buck with it . '  Standing with a gun almost as tall as her , Matt McCracken 's daughter is ten-year-old - the same age as Liza Ryan  Rob O'Donnell claimed it was his duty to support his daughters learning how to shoot - just like like Paul Ryan  An avid hunter and outdoorsman , Paul Ryan somewhat expectedly found himself under attack when he took a break from a bus tour through Ohio to shop at Outdoor World for 15 minutes to buy his 10-year-old ddaughter Liza camouflage gear .  He told the reporters who followed him that he is going to take her deer hunting this fall in Wisconsin and Oklahoma , which is where his wife 's family lives .  ` She 's going to get to go hunting this year for the first time , ' said Ryan , who has previously told the press that he bought his daughter a Remington 700 . 243 junior model rifle last Christmas .  ` She 's 10-years-old , so she can hunt starting at 10 .  ` She 's been getting ready , she 's been practicing .  ' I just need to get her some clothes . '  The controversy started after Paul Ryan was seen to buy his ten-year-old daughter hunting gear while he took a break from campaigning in Ohio  Buying his girl gloves and a jacket for $ 101.14 , Ryan has spoken at length in the past about his love of American outdoor pursuits .  He has pointedly said ` Hey , I 'm a Catholic deer hunter . I am happy to be clinging to my guns and my religion ' , which is a dig at President Obama who made a campaign speech in San Francisco in 2008 in which he said some voters , ` cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who are n't like them . '  But in comparison to his boss , Paul Ryan is a big-game hunter comparable to Theodore Roosevelt .  ` I 'm not a big-game hunter . I 've made that very clear . I 've always been a rodent and rabbit hunter . Small varmints , if you will , ' said Mitt Romney in 2008 , during his first unsuccessful tilt at the U.S. presidency .  Republican vice presidential Paul Ryan waves as he walks with his  L-R  son Sam , daughter Liza , wife Janna , son Charlie and mother Betty Douglas after accepting the nomination during the third session of the 2012 Republican National Convention  Paul Ryan has described himself as a Catholic deer hunter who is happy to cling to his guns and religion  The support for Ryan , 42 , followed the initial backlash his shopping trip for his daughter first provoked .  One Twitter user , Troy Martez took to the site to post the message that ` Aww ! There 's nothing sweeter than a Dad and a daughter bonding over the body of a dead animal they probably wo n't eat . '  Another user called @nschim posted : ` Ryan gets daughter a rifle ??? Maybe its for her shotgun wedding if she is not allowed to use birth control . '  According to an interview with Deer & Hunting magazine , Ryan ` shoots a Mathews Z7Xtreme compound and loves the thrill of bow-hunting , but also enjoys firearms . '  ` My daughter she 's been hunting with me for years , watching me , but she 's old enough this year to hunt on her own .  ` She 's really looking forward to it . '  An earlier version of this article carried a caption that suggested the girl in the first image was holding a military grade assault rifle . We are happy to clarify that this is not the case .

Charred debris fell from the Webbs ' home fell 75 feet into the lake on Friday after fire crews set the $ 700,000 retreat ablaze rather than wait for it to crumble into the water as the land faltered around it .

121	Just in time for the holidays , a Louisiana judge ruled on Thursday that a woman had a right to offer her neighbors an unusual seasons greeting by hanging Christmas lights on her house shaped like a middle finger .  Sarah Childs was in a dispute with some of her neighbors in Denham Springs , just east of Baton Rouge , so she decided to send a message with her decorations .  Neighbors complained and police threatened to arrest her , so she teamed up with the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana and sued the city .  Christmas may be over , but Sarah Henderson wants to continue with her ` rude ' lighting display to get her own back a neighbor  Henderson now says the display was a message to a neighbor who she believes stole her dog  ` I imagine it will be back up before too long , ' ACLU of Louisiana executive director Marjorie Esman said of the display .  Childs put up the lights on her roof last month . She has removed them twice since - once after a police officer told her she could be fined and again after another officer threatened to arrest her , her lawsuit said .  U.S. District Judge James Brady issued an order temporarily barring city officials from interfering with the display . The two-page order said the city 's ` continued efforts ' to prevent Childs from displaying her holiday lights will violate her rights to free speech and due process .  Denham Springs attorney Paeton Burkett said the city will comply with Brady 's order , but she declined to comment on the lawsuit .  ` We 're going to sit down with everybody involved and see if there 's any merit to it , ' she said .  Mayor Jimmy Durbin and Police Chief Scott Jones , who are named as defendants , did n't immediately respond to calls seeking comment .  The suit said the police department dispatched an officer to Childs ' home after several neighbors complained directly to the mayor .  The officer told Childs she would be violating the city 's ` obscenity statute '' and could be fined if she did n't take it down , according to the lawsuit . However , Denham Springs does n't have an obscenity statute , the suit said .  Childs removed the lights but put them back up after the ACLU defended her in an open letter to the city . That time , the display showed two hands with extended middle fingers .  After another round of complaints , the city responded with a ` collateral attack , ' issuing her two tickets , according to the suit . One accused her of obstructing the flow of traffic as she walked down the side of a street .  Another ticket accused her of disturbing the peace while singing an impromptu song about her neighborhood dispute while standing in her driveway .  Henderson has twice removed the lights from her roof , but with the support of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana she is attempting to sue the city , its mayor and police  ` Childs ' impromptu song allegedly contained some obscenities directed at her neighbors , so the city cited her for simple assault , ' the suit said .  The lawsuit filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana in Baton Rouge seeks an injunction , damages and attorney 's fees .  The ACLU would not say exactly what the neighborhood dispute was about , and a no one answered at a telephone listing for Childs .  ` This is a victory for the First Amendment and the rule of law , ' said Margorie Esman , executive director for the ACLU of Louisiana .  A hearing on Childs ' request for a preliminary injunction will be held on January 7 .  Childs , a mother of four children aged between 4 and 16 , admits she deliberately fashioned her light display to look like a human hand ` flipping the bird ' .  She said the middle finger salute was a message to some of her neighbors whom she has been involved in a year-long dispute with .  ` They put themselves into affairs of mine that they had no business in , ' she told WBRZ . ` They spread vicious lies throughout the neighborhood . '  Henderson had initially agreed to remove the offending display after she received a visit from Denham Spring Police . Corporal Shawn Perkins informed Henderson that her display was in violation of obscenity laws and that she faced the possibility of a $ 300 or $ 400 fine .  Traditional display : Henderson 's neighbor Gemma Rachel said Christmas lights should be something wholesome for children to enjoy  Childs said she could have fought the request , but she decided to take the lights down out of respect for her mayor and city council .  One local neighbor , Gemma Rachel told WBRZ that while she has n't have anything personal against Childs , she did n't think the lights were an appropriate symbol for young children to be exposed to .  ` Christmas lights should be something for kids to enjoy ' she told WBRZ .  Since taking down her lights , Childs has received support from the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana .  Marjorie Essman , executive director at the ACLU , has sent a letter to the Denham Springs chief of police saying the city has no right to restrict Childs ' expression purely because it , or Childs ' neighbors , finds it vulgar or offensive .  In the letter , Esman wrote : ` The Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeal , which presides over Louisiana , Texas and Mississippi , has specifically commented on the protected expressive nature of a middle finger extended in defiance or protest : `` The thumbed nose , the projected middle finger , the Bronx cheer , the grimace and the smile are all conduct intended to convey a message that is sometimes made even more expressive by its bold freedom from a garb of words . '' Davis v. Williams .

122	In the comic book the shooter opens fire during Led Zeppelin 's Stairway To Heaven - which is said to contain a message to Satan  By Daily Mail Reporter  PUBLISHED :  15:08 EST , 20 July 2012   |  UPDATED :  15:50 EST , 20 July 2012  The Dark Knight cinema massacre may have been inspired by a Batman comic book strip , it emerged on Friday .  The bloodbath is a chilling copycat of a 25-year-old Batman comic strip which features a deranged gunman opening fire in a cinema .

They recorded it backwards .  ` Arnold Crimp took the album from the record store where he worked until they fired him this afternoon and transferred Stairway to Heaven to tape .  ` Then he played the tape backwards .

124	Salvage experts believe that the AirAsia jet which crashed into the sea with 162 people on board exploded on impact .  Suryadi Supriyadi , a director with the Indonesian national search and rescue agency , suggested initial analysis of the wreckage showed that the aircraft shattered because the cabin had not depressurised when it slammed into the water , Sky reported .  Mr Supriyadi said : ` The cabin was pressurised and before the pressure of the cabin could be adjusted , it went down - boom . That explosion was heard in the area . '  A team of navy divers earlier on Monday retrieved the flight data recorder from the wreckage . Divers have also found the second black box , but they have not yet been able to free it from debris on the floor of the Java Sea .  Scroll down for video  Chief of the National Transportation Safety Board Tatang Kurniadi  left  speaks to the media while showing the flight data recorder that was retrieved from the first black box  Indonesian army and naval personnel look at the flight data recorder that was in the first black box  Associated Press reported that Mr Supriyadi confirmed the cockpit voice recorder was located on Monday just hours after officials announced that the other black box - the data flight recorder - had been brought to the surface .  He said the second black box was stuck under heavy wreckage , and divers are now working to lift it .  The flight recorder monitors data such as airspeed and the aircraft 's heading , while the cockpit voice recorder stores radio transmissions and sounds from within the cockpit .  Sky 's Beijing Correspondent Mark Stone said : ` Experts will be looking at data which recorded the performance of the engines or other instrument in the cockpit . All of that will be taken to Jakarta and analysed in great detail .  ` The conversations the crew had with ground control units in Singapore and Indonesia are already known , but they do not know what conversations took place on the flight deck .  The flight data recorder that was in the first retrieved black box is placed on a table for the media to see  Indonesian military police carry the flight data recorder through Iskandar air base in Pangkalan Bun , Central Borneo  ` They know there was no Mayday issued and the cockpit recorder , when it is found , could reveal why . '  Searchers began zeroing in on the sites a day earlier after three Indonesian ships picked up intense pings from the area . The flight data recorder was brought to the surface by four divers early on Monday morning .  The cockpit voice and flight data recorders are vital to understanding what brought Flight 8501 down on December 28 , killing all 162 people on board .  Officials said last week when the recorders were found they would be taken to Jakarta for analysis .  It could take up to two weeks to download data , investigators said , although the information could be accessed in as little as two days if the devices are not badly damaged .  The news comes after the tail section of the AirAsia aircraft was pulled from the sea off the coast of central Borneo on Saturday .  A photograph emerged on Sunday of an AirAsia search team member appearing to be pose in front of the downed jet 's tail .  Military policemen carry the flight data recorder of AirAsia QZ8501 away to be evaluated  Indonesian officers take the plane 's flight data recorder and move it into a large plastic container  Still dripping with water , military personnel pull out the flight data recorder of the ill-fated AirAsia Flight 8501 that crashed in the Java Sea  In the picture taken on board a ship , the searcher looks to be smiling while a colleague holds up a smart phone to snap the moment .  The man standing in front of the tail , which was pulled from the sea off the coast of Indonesian island Borneo two weeks after flight QZ8501 crashed , is wearing a uniform .  Indonesia AirAsia Flight QZ8501 lost contact with air traffic control in bad weather on December 28 , less than halfway into a two-hour flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore .  None of the 162 people on the aircraft survived . So far 48 bodies have been recovered from the site , including at least two still strapped into their seats .  Many of the other passengers are believed to be inside the wreckage of the plane 's main cabin , which has not been located , due to strong currents moving debris around .  At two weeks , most corpses will sink , said Anton Castilani , head of Indonesia 's disaster identification victim unit , and there are already signs of serious decomposition .  ` Divers have reached the tail part but ... the visibility was below one metre so they only managed to retrieve various debris , ' said Bambang Soelistyo , chief of Indonesia 's search and rescue agency .  ` Now we are waiting for the speed of the current to ease . If it gets calmer later , they will go back to do another dive to determine whether the black boxes remained in the tail or were detached , ' Mr Soelistyo said .  The AirAsia aircraft 's flight data recorder in its black box is unloaded by Indonesian Air Force flight crew  Airbus investigators examines part of the tail of AirAsia QZ8501  Indonesian officers carry a part of the tail section of the AirAsia plane away to be scrutinized  Mr Marsma Supriyadi , operations coordinator for the National Search and Rescue Agency said earlier on Sunday a sonar scan had revealed an object measuring 10 metres by four metres by 2.5 metres on the sea floor .  ` They suspect it is the body of the plane . There is a big possibility that the black box is near the body of the plane , ' Mr Supriyadi said in the town of Pangkalan Bun , the base for the search effort on Borneo .  ` If it is the body of the plane then we will first evacuate the victims . Secondly we will search for the black box . '  Families of the victims whose bodies have been recovered held funeral ceremonies to lay their loved ones to rest .

The recovery operation comes as news that the families of the victims of the flight will be offered $ US100 ,000 in compensation by the airline .

125	Saido Berahino scored twice for West Brom playing up front on his own . To see his heat map and more from our brilliant match zone , click here  The scale of West Bromwich Albion 's success in finding three wins in eight days can be measured by the changing chants from the Hawthorns stands .  Head coach Alan Irvine was asked for a wave and captain Chris Brunt heard his name sung .  During their previous Premier League home match -- a defeat by Everton -- Irvine was booed and Brunt jeered .  Since then , however , Tottenham and Hull have been defeated and this rout , the club 's biggest win since February 2012 , boosted the feelgood factor as much as their league position . True , Burnley provided weak opposition but some of West Brom 's attacking play , spearheaded by Saido Berahino , suggested the good times can continue .  Saido Berahino  second right  nods the ball home for West Brom 's second goal  Berahino slides the ball past Tom Heaton 11 minutes into the second half to seal the victory for West Brom  West Brom  4-2-3-1  : Foster 6.5 ; Wisdom 7 , Dawson 7.5 , Lescott 7.5 , Pocognoli 7.5  Gamboa 83min  ; Gardner 6.5  Yacob 87  , Morrison 7 ; Dorrans 7.5 , Sessegnon 7  Samaras 74 , 6  , Brunt 7.5 ; Berahino 8 .

This was the first time since November 2012 that Albion have recorded three consecutive victories in all competitions and they leapt from 17th place to 10th in one afternoon .  Berahino scored twice to become the leading English marksman in the top flight with four goals and back up his pre-match claim that to win senior international honours is not an unrealistic ambition .  With Roy Hodgson 's assistant Ray Lewington and England coach Gary Neville in the stands it is feasible the 21-year-old could be given a call-up for next month 's European qualifiers -- particularly with Daniel Sturridge recovering from injury and Rickie Lambert faltering .  England manager Hodgson knows Berahino from his time at West Brom . ` If he keeps on playing like that he 'll get all those rewards , ' said Irvine . ` I do n't think Roy will be looking and saying he 's too young but right now Saido has just got to keep working as he does . '  Berahino , with eight goals in 11 games for England Under 21s , nodded in from two yards on the stroke of half-time to make it 2-0 and then applied a precise finish 11 minutes after the interval .  Craig Dawson had opened the scoring in the 31st minute and Graham Dorrans grabbed the goal his performance deserved with a clinical shot in the final minute .  ` We wo n't get carried away , ' said Berahino . ` We will focus and go to Liverpool  on Saturday  and make sure we get something there . '  For Burnley the worry is they have added defensively fragility to their limited offensive capabilities . This was their fifth Premier League game in a row without scoring , making it 526 minutes since Scott Arfield hit their only goal of the season against Chelsea .  Three points had been accrued via goalless draws to give Sean Dyche 's side the joint best defensive record in the division alongside Southampton going into this match . But their resistance crumbled spectacularly here .  ` That 's a massive learning curve , ' said Dyche , shorn of his usual midfield through injuries to David Jones and Dean Marney . ` We were carrying too many players today . '  Burnley 's poor scoring record must be a huge concern . ` That needs to be dealt with , ' he said . ` Players get that weird feeling , `` When are we going to score ? ''  ` One of the big mantras I say to the players is , `` Be the man who makes a difference '' . '  Craig Dawson snuffs out the danger of Burnley 's George Boyd and shepherds the ball out of play in the first couple of minutes  Stephane Sessegnon  left  passes the ball under pressure from former Albion midfielder Steven Reid  centre  and Scott Arfield  On-loan West Brom defender Andre Wisdom gets up ahead of Michael Kightly to win the ball in the air  Dawson  left  leaps above Burnley defender Jason Shackell to give West Brom the lead at The Hawthorns  Dawson  centre  gets up and heads the ball back across goal past all the bodies and in for the game 's opener  West Brom midfielder James Morrison  centre  and Burnley 's Arfield  left  battle for the ball as Sessegnon takes a keen interest  Graham Dorrans slides in to challenge Burnley full back Ben Mee  Burnley 's veteran centre half Michael Duff gets to grip with Sessegnon during the first half  Irvine stuck with the team that won 1-0 at Spurs and it paid off . Dawson got the ball rolling , scoring against the club who tried three times to buy him in the summer . The defender should be glad his transfer request was rejected . Dawson rose higher than Jason Shackell to head in Brunt 's corner for his first West Brom goal .  Albion 's second came from the same source , although this time James Morrison delivered the corner , Dorrans flicked on and Berahino applied the final nod .  Then Berahino got his second with a neat finish across Tom Heaton and though Burnley tried to claw their way back into the game , West Brom keeper Ben Foster did well to save from Lukas Jutkiewicz .  West Brom supporters have taken to serenading their head coach with the chant , ` Alan **** ing Irvine ' , and did so again as the football flowed .  ` I 've probably been called that a few times but not so much in that context , ' said the Glaswegian with a smile . He hopes the fans keep having cause to turn the air blue with joy .  Berahino  second right  looks at the ball as it nestles in the corner for West Brom 's second goal  Berahino  second left  is congratulated as West Brom celebrate going 2-0 ahead  Burnley manager Sean Dyche looks inconsolable as his side go in 2-0 down in the first half at The Hawthorns  Berahino strikes the ball with his golden boots and makes it 3-0 to the home side  Saido Berahino slotted the ball past Tom Heaton for West Brom 's third goal ... for more go to our brilliant Match Zone  Lukas Jutkiewicz takes a ride on Dawson 's back but it was a frustrating afternoon for the Burnley striker  Dorrans  left  celebrates with Berahino after scoring West Brom 's fourth goal at The Hawthorns  	  Craig Dawson headed West Bromwich Albion into the lead from a corner    Saido Berahino nodded in the second from close range on stroke of half-time    The forward sealed the victory for West Brom with a good finish 11 minutes into the second half    Graham Dorrans scored fourth goal in added time	Saido Berahino scored twice for West Brom playing up front on his own .

127	Valley Stream sits just north east of John F Kennedy airport  By Victoria Wellman  PUBLISHED :  13:08 EST , 11 September 2012   |  UPDATED :  14:42 EST , 11 September 2012  The residents of two Long Island homes were woken at 3.30 am on Sunday by a calamitous crashing noise as large and heavy debris of some kind fell through both their roofs .  Neighbours Lois Farella and Anne Grace of Valley Stream now have gaping holes in their roofs the cause of which is believed to be frozen waste - known as ` blue ice ' - that most likely leaked from a passing aircraft .  The FAA is investigating the possibility that a plane 's faulty sewage tank might be responsible for the damage done to the shingles , the plywood and even the layer of insulation of the houses .  Write caption here  ` It 's a very huge hole . It did a lot of damage through heavy wood . I ca n't imagine if it hit a person , ' Ms Grace told CBS of the destruction caused on her home .  Her elderly neighbour who now has a basketball-sized hole in her own roof , recalled : ` We both woke up to a very loud bang . I looked around - no breeze , no rain , nothing . '  Roofer Bryan Lanzello discovered a wet , brown stain inside the attic below the large fissure in Ms Grace 's roof and said he could n't imagine what , other than something from a plane , could have fallen that hard and fast .  Valley Stream sits just north east of John F Kennedy airport so planes probably fly overhead frequently .  Write caption here  Crater : The hole in Lois Farella 's roof is roughly the shape of a basketball  Debris : Whatever came through the roof penetrated not only shingles but plywood and insulation too so must have been heavy or dropped from a great height  ` That 's a lot of blunt force that did that -LSB- and it -RSB- was coming from a distance . It blew through and inch and a half of shingles and those shingles are tough , ' he remarked .  But the FAA claims on its website that reports of such incidents are rarely anything at all to do with air traffic and that brown stains could easily be attributed to large groups of migrating birds laying waste en route .  In a fact sheet the Federal Aviation Administration address a list of what it refers to as ` myths ' surrounding the subject , debunking the notion that planes routinely dump sewage in mid-flight .  ` Manufacturers take great care to ensure this holding tank is secure , ' it reads . ` It 's physically impossible for a pilot to dump a tank while in flight . The apparatus to access the tank is located on the exterior of the plane .  Mystery : The FAA are investigating but say that reports of such incidents are rarely anything to do with aeroplane waste as often as they are the migrating birds dropping feces  Hygiene : Aeroplane bathrooms like this one use a blue coloured deodorising chemical in the toilet bowl that also breaks down solids  ` That exterior lever means only the ground crew can operate the valve that opens the tank while the plane is on the ground .  ` Even if the tank were to break it goes on , ` blue ice ' , named for the colour of the disinfectant liquid in plane toilet bowls , would not land in solid form .  ` Modern commercial aircraft cruise at high altitudes , and the sub-zero temperatures will cause any liquid to freeze immediately , hence the term `` Blue Ice , '' ' the site clarifies before adding , ` If any of this `` Blue Ice '' were to fall from an aircraft , it would melt long before it hit the ground , dissipating into miniscule droplets that are nearly invisible . '  According to the FAA , phone calls claiming to report craters caused by ` blue ice ' increase dramatically around Fall when birds begin to migrate .  Conclusions : Roofer , Bryan Lanzello discovered a wet , brown stain inside the attic below the large frissure in Ms Grace 's roof and said he could n't imagine what else could have caused the damage  Home sweet home : The FAA will check to see if any planes passed over Anne Grace 's Valley Streams neighbourhood on Sunday night  No shelter here : Lois Farella says now she has been told she has to get an entirely new roof which could cost thousands of dollars  ` Bird migration also occurs during a time when fruit trees are ripening , ' claims the FAA in a final attempt to put claims of falling feces to rest . ` As the fruit goes through a bird 's digestive system it loses none of its color , which means if it was blue going in , it will be blue coming out . '  Authorities , have been looking into what might have caused the damage in Long Island and comparing the timing to the flight schedule over the area on Sunday night .  If there were planes passing overhead at 3.30 am then they will have to investigate further to find out which airline may be at fault for having a tank in disrepair .  An FAA spokesman said that at this time , the case was ` inclusive ' .  Arlene Salac told MailOnline : We could n't determine if it was blue ice as radar tracks from the area showed there were no planes overhead at the time the residents said the debris fell .  ` The nearest plane was three miles away . There is no blue residue and no sign of aircraft parts around the house . Unless it happened at a different time of day or we get more information we can not tell what happened '  	  Damage is believed to have been made by falling ` blue ice ' - the name given to frozen airplane sewage    FAA officials are investigating but say it 's more likely due to migrating birds    Phone calls claiming ` blue ice ' damage increase around the Fall when birds migrate says FAA    Roofer says impact penetrated shingles and plywood so must have fallen from very high    Valley Stream sits just north east of John F Kennedy airport	Valley Stream sits just north east of John F Kennedy airport  By Victoria Wellman  PUBLISHED :  13:08 EST , 11 September 2012   |  UPDATED :  14:42 EST , 11 September 2012  The residents of two Long Island homes were woken at 3.30 am on Sunday by a calamitous crashing noise as large and heavy debris of some kind fell through both their roofs .

128	The earliest known piece of polyphonic music - a piece of choral music written for more than one part - has be uncovered at the British Library .  It is thought that the simple score , that is is dedicated to Boniface , patron Saint of Germany , was written around the year 900 .  The piece was discovered by Giovanni Varelli , a PhD student from St John 's College , University of Cambridge , while he was working on an internship .  Scroll down to hear the music sung  Mystery dong : It is thought that the simple score , that is is dedicated to Boniface , patron Saint of Germany , was written around the year 900 , although who wrote it remains unknown  The chant was written using an early form of notation that predates the invention of the stave and was inked into the space at the end of a manuscript of the Life of Bishop Maternianus of Reims .  Student Varelli specialises in early musical notation , and realised that it consisted of two vocal parts , each complementing the other .  Polyphony defined most European music up until the 20th century , but it is not clear exactly when it emerged .  Treatises which lay out the theoretical basis for music with two independent vocal parts survive from the early Middle Ages , but until now the earliest known examples of a practical piece written specifically for more than one voice came from a collection known as The Winchester Troper , which dates back to the year 1000 .  Polyphony defined most European music up until the 20th century , but it is not clear exactly when it emerged . Here the newly discovered song has been transcribed into modern music using a stave  As well as its age , the piece is also significant because it deviates from the convention laid out in treatises at the time .  In music , polyphony is when two or more lines of independent melody is sung or played in harmony .  This is opposed to music with just one voice , called monophony .  Music with one dominant melodic voice accompanied by chords is called homophony .  The term is usually used to refer to music of the late Middle Ages and Renaissance .  Until now the Winchester Troper , dating back to the 11th century , was thought to be the oldest example of notated polyphony for chanting .  This suggests that even at this early stage , composers were experimenting with form and breaking the rules of polyphony at the same time as they were being written .  ` What 's interesting here is that we are looking at the birth of polyphonic music and we are not seeing what we expected , ' Varelli said .  ` Typically , polyphonic music is seen as having developed from a set of fixed rules and almost mechanical practice .  ` This changes how we understand that development precisely because whoever wrote it was breaking those rules .  ` It shows that music at this time was in a state of flux and development , the conventions were less rules to be followed , than a starting point from which one might explore new compositional paths .

130	NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams had pitched to NBC and CBS about making him the next late-night show host before he was busted for falsifying stories .  Williams , 55 , is currently suspended from NBC without pay as a team investigates claims he lied in reports about the Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina , among others .  But prior to the suspension he had agreed to a five-year anchor deal with Nightly News after being persuaded into it with a gift of veteran broadcaster Edward R Murrow 's old desk .  Brian Williams agreed to a five-year contract after being persuaded by NBC News President Deborah Turness , who gifted him with veteran broadcaster Edward R Murrow 's old writing desk  And few years ago , Williams told NBC Universal CEO Steve Burke that he wanted to take over the Tonight Show from Jay Leno .  Burke turned down Williams 's idea and instead offered him a weekly program called Rock Center , which Williams hoped could evolve into a variety show .  Instead , the show ended up mirroring 60 minutes and it was canceled after two seasons , according to New York Magazine .  Williams pushed on , however , and went to CBS CEO Les Moonves to suggest succeeding David Letterman . Moonves was n't interested , sources told New York Magazine .  Williams then had to be convinced through lengthy negotiations to become a news anchor by NBC News president Deborah Turness .  Though they first clashed - because Williams was used to having the final say over a show 's content - the pair eventually warmed to one another .  Brian Williams suggested succeeding both Jay Leno  left  and David Letterman  right  . CEOs from NBC and CBS turned down his offers  Williams sent Turness a note over the holidays that read , ' 2015 is going to be our year together ' , according to New York Magazine .  He went on to agree to a new five-year anchor deal , during the same dinner Turness presented him with Murrow 's old writing desk .  She had found the 1940s desk through a Los Angeles-based antique dealer .  And less than two months later , Williams was publicly shamed for a backlog of fictional stories and executives struggled with how to deal with the situation .  This comes just after speculations that Katie Couric might be is in talks NBC 's incoming chairman Andrew Lack to make a return by replacing Williams on the Nightly News .  ` It makes sense  that she could come back  because she is so closely associated with the brand , ' a source told the New York Daily News .  Lack ` has not made up his mind ' as to whether or not Williams will return when his six-month suspension is up , according to New York Magazine 's sources .  A ` close friend ' of Williams said the the magazine , however , that the anchor ` ca n't wait until he can speak ' , which he ca n't do publicly until his suspension ends .

Olympic legend Vonn , 29 , underwent major surgery to repair her anterior cruciate ligaments 11 months ago - but frustratingly aggravated the same injury six weeks ago during a training session in Colorado and again in December in France .  In a statement this morning , the gold medal winning downhill skier announced her decision to withdraw from the games - robbing the event of arguably its biggest star .  ' I am devastated to announce that I will not be able to compete in Sochi . I did everything I possibly could to somehow get strong enough to overcome having no ACL but the reality has sunk in that my knee is just too unstable to compete at this level .

I will be cheering for all of the Olympians and especially team USA ! '  She took home two medals from the 2010 Vancouver Games , becoming the first American woman to win an Olympic gold in the downhill .  Vonn is also a four-time overall World Cup champion , the most recognized name in Alpine skiing -- and , as it happens , the girlfriend of Tiger Woods .  Vonn last month suffered a worrying crash in the women 's World Cup downhill .  In front of boyfriend Tiger Woods , she missed a gate at Val d'Isere as her troublesome right knee buckled under her and gave way .  The golfer and Vonn announced they were dating in March and Vonn became a fixture at Tiger 's PGA tournaments .  Both have been married before .  Vonn wed 2002 Olympic skier Thomas Vonn in 2007 . They separated in 2011 and finalized the divorce in January - one month before Lindsey Vonn 's crash .  According to a statement released by her publicist , ` an MRI showed an MCL sprain , which coupled with the torn ACL , has made it impossible to stabilize her knee and be ready to safely ski again next month .

She hoped to improve on her 2010 Olympic performance , pictured , in which she won a gold medal and bronze  The loss of Vonn to injury will also prove a huge disappointment to the corporate backers of these controversial games .  NBC has been heavily promoting the games with Vonn as the American face and is heavily sponsored by Red Bull , Rolex and Oakley - among others .  Her return to Olympic competition was expected to culminate in one of the stories of the games - with a win for Vonn the ultimate comeback tale .  ` While Lindsey wo n't be in Sochi , we have a strong team that is well prepared to challenge , ' Marolt said .  ` The women 's speed team is experienced with five athletes who have achieved World Cup podiums and a seasoned veteran in Julia Mancuso , who has won three Olympic medals in her career .

Her decision to pull out of the games is especially upsetting for the four-time World Cup winner because of the painstaking work she has put in to repair her knee after a shocking tumble on the slopes of Schlamding , Austria , in February last year .  She suffered a torn ACL and tibial fracture and even then vowed to return stronger and better in time for February 's Olympic Games in Sochi , Russia .  However , in November she suffered a setback when she partially tore one of her surgically repaired right knee during a training crash on Copper Mountain , Colorado .  ' I do n't think I was pushing myself too hard , ' she told Matt Lauer on TODAY after her setback in November .  ` It just was unfortunately a fluke accident . That 's the risk you take when you 're going 80-90 miles an hour down a mountain . That 's just part of the job , but I 've picked myself back up , and I 'm trying as hard as I can to keep going .

Chelsea 's Branislav Ivanovic wrestles with Chris Smalling while on the right , John Terry grapples Marcos Rojo  Referees are ready to clampdown on the dark arts highlighted in Sportsmail 's ` Hands Off In The Box ' campaign  Chelsea defenders Terry and Ivanovic go to ground after they were held in the box at Old Trafford  Stoke City 's assistant Mark Bowen had said Ryan Shawcross would be taken off man marking duties but he was all over Graziano Pelle during his side 's defeat by Southampton on Wednesday  Shawcross  right  conceded a penalty against Swansea after grappling with Wilfried Bony  centre right   They are then likely to inform managers and players how they plan to interpret the rules .  Sportsmail highlighted the issue after recent inconsistency towards blatant foul play at corners and free-kicks .  Phil Dowd 's failure to penalise Manchester United players for challenges against Chelsea came a week after Stoke 's Ryan Shawcross was punished with a penalty against Swansea for a similar offence .  ` Because it 's not a change of law this is something the PGMOL can do almost immediately , ' explained former referee Graham Poll . ` It 's simply a change of emphasis .  Gary Cahill takes a tumble during Chelsea 's 2-1 Capital One Cup win against Shrewsbury on Tuesday night  Cahill uses his body to get the better of Shrewsbury striker James Collins at Greenhous Meadow  ` It 's just a case of establishing some consistency with all 16 of them . Do they agree it 's a yellow card , or a penalty or so on ?  ` Once that is established they would contact the clubs and inform them that the players will be punished accordingly in future . When it 's as obvious as this you have to take action . '  Chelsea 's Gary Cahill has become the first defender to back our campaign . He said : ` There 's a difference between touching the player , getting your arm across , and grabbing hold of somebody . The Ryan Shawcross one got punished recently so maybe it 's one the referees are looking at . '  John Terry , Chelsea captain  ` Me and Branislav Ivanovic were double headlocked at every corner . '  Colin Pascoe , Liverpool assistant manager  ` Grappling . That is the new word is it ? It is the referees ' interpretation and we 'll leave it to them . That 's what the referees and the officials are paid for . They make decisions . So whatever they decide is grappling , or holding , it 's in their hands really . Did I do it as player ? No , I was a winger and did n't have to mark anyone . '  Ian Wright , Ex-Arsenal striker  ` There should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set-pieces . It was like UFC in the United area . '  Graham Poll , Former top referee  ` Hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned . Once fans , managers and -- crucially -- players accept it as normal , this campaign will have achieved its aims . '  Martin Keown , Ex-Arsenal defender  ` Defenders are checking , blocking , holding , grappling , using force to foul opponents -- and too often referees are allowing it to take place . '  Micky Mellon , Shrewsbury Town manager  ` In a congested area how can you judge if someone 's been blocked ? It 's part of the game and some people are good at it . It 's football . A local Football League referee came in and he was asking me about it . ` Can you show me some blocking techniques ? ' That was great , he was trying to find ways of detecting it . The confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free-kicks , but the same wo n't be given as penalties . There has to be consistency . '  And the readers of MailOnline ...  ` It 's more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves . It 's about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players . ' Willdajack , Neath  ` To those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties , that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop . I 've been watching football since the Sixties and the cheating behaviour in the penalty area now is the worst I 've ever seen .

137	Judge Mike Maggio posted details of actress Charlize Theron 's adoption online has been barred for life  A judge who posted details of actress Charlize Theron 's adoption online and complained about wives who would n't have sex has been barred for life  The state Supreme Court accepted the lifetime ban that was agreed to by Faulkner County Circuit Judge Mike Maggio and the Arkansas Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission .  The disciplinary panel ruled last month that , using the pseudonym ` geauxjudge , ' Maggio entered an online forum of Louisiana State University sports fans and shared details from Theron 's 2012 adoption of a baby in the same court division where he served .  Comments in January 2012 divulged details of Theron 's adoption two months before she publicly released the information , while others talked about women in a derogatory way and another likened bestiality to sex in the transgender and gay communities .  He said a ` judge friend ' handled the case , before admitting that he was also involved in the case .  When a poster asked if she had adopted a black child , he said that she had .  Such proceedings are confidential in Arkansas , and there are no cases in the state 's online court records that mention Theron 's name . Her publicist , Amanda Silverman , declined to comment .  In a June 2011 posting , ` geauxjudge ' suggested that women who seek divorces after their husbands cheat may be better off financially by staying married . In Arkansas , circuit judges like Maggio handle divorce cases , among other civil and criminal casework .  Revealed : He divulged that Charlize Theron had adopted a son two months before she announced it publicly in 2012 . She is pictured in 2013 with the boy , Jackson , whom she adopted from South Africa  ' I see it everyday , ' he wrote . ' A woman makes  an  emotional decision to divorce because the husband stepped out . When otherwise he was a good provider , father , and husband .  ` Then a year or two later realizes uh oh I am worse off financially , emotionally and relationship wise but hey they showed that SOB . Too many times the women get their advice from other divorced women . '  In another , Maggio , who has three sons and two daughters from a previous relationship and lives with his partner , Dawn , made derogatory comments about women , saying they needed to take care of a man 's two basic needs for sex and food , adding : ` It takes two to pull the wagon ' .  Confidential : Postings on the website TigerDroppings.com show him discussing confidential information  Responding to a story about a woman who was arrested for allegedly having sex with a dog , ` geauxjudge ' wrote that it was ` just a small step ' from having ` TGGLBS ' sex , an apparent reference to transgender , gay , lesbian or bisexual sex .  And in 2012 , he suggested that people can beat a drunken-driving charge by not cooperating with police and expressed a desire to obtain evidence photos from a case involving a cheerleader accused of sex with a minor .  Concerning opnions : Maggio , who has five children , is pictured with his partner , Dawn , left and right  In a 2009 post about divorce , Maggio wrote he was tired of hearing complaints that husbands work all the time while a wife withholds sex and becomes unattractive and non-supportive . ` What did she think was going to happen ... , ' he wrote .  Today the state Supreme Court e court rejected the panel 's recommendation that he be suspended with pay until his term expires at the end of 2014 , and instead ordered his immediate removal from the bench .  ` We deem any further suspension with pay to be inappropriate , ' the court said in its order .  ` Therefore , we order the removal of Judge Maggio from judicial office , effective as the date of this opinion .  ` By this order , Judge Maggio is henceforth prohibited from holding any judicial office in the state of Arkansas . '  Maggio , who has been a judge since 2001 , dropped his bid for a seat on the state Court of Appeals earlier this year after admitting to the posts .  Justices also accepted the panel 's decision to , in exchange for Maggio agreeing to step aside , drop its look at an Ethics Commission complaint that ended with Maggio paying a $ 750 fine to settle allegations he received improper campaign contributions .  The disciplinary panel opened an investigation March 3 after the Blue Hog Report website noted a series of posts appeared to be coming from Maggio .

138	Dawn Jewell with her beloved horse before he was killed  A mutilated pet horse found knifed to death by its owner may have been sacrificed as part of a Satanic ritual , police today revealed .  Two-year-old stallion Eric was found dead in a field in Stithians , near Falmouth , Cornwall , with his right eye gouged out , his teeth removed , and his testicles sliced off .  Officers are now investigating the possibility that Eric was killed as part of a Satanic ritual as his death occurred on the same weekend as St Winebald Day .  Niche Satanic websites describe St Winebald Day on Saturday , January 7 , as a date for ` blood rituals , dismemberment , animal and human sacrifice ' in the Satanic calendar .  Another pony , called Barney , in Carmarthenshire was also attacked and killed in similar circumstances to Eric over the same weekend - and investigators have n't ruled out that the killing could also be connected to Satanic worshipers .  Devon and Cornwall Police Inspector , Chris Strickland , said : ` There are many lines of inquiry but this is obviously one line we 're going to pursue .  ` We will be keeping an open mind until more information comes to light . '  Eric was attacked over the same weekend as the Satanic festival , between 4pm on Sunday and midday on Monday , when the horse 's owner , Dawn Jewell , discovered his mutilated body .  Sunday night also saw a full moon - which also holds significance for Satanic rituals .  Inspector Strickland added that he was aware of discussions on internet forums linking the killing to a Satanic ritual and admitted this was a ` strong possibility ' but insisted police also had other leads .  He said : ' I have done my own research on the internet and there are people out there who have these beliefs and so that is a strong possibility , but there are other leads we have got as well and other possibilities or motives . '  Officers search for clues on Dawn Jewell 's land after her prized stallion was killed in a similar attack  Eric 's owner said she was devastated by what had happened to the horse she had raised from a foal .  Her mother , Vivien Allaway , said they were both ` well aware of rumours and speculation about Satanic links .  She said : ` It 's not based on fact , but it 's plausible so we ca n't dismiss it ' .  Initial post-mortem tests were carried out on Erik and a full forensic examination will be conducted .  Dyfed-Powys Police have revealed they are also investigating an attack on a pony in Carmarthenshire on January 5 , which saw the animal suffer similar injuries to Erik , where its eyes had been gouged out .  Seven-year-old Barney the pony was found butchered in a field when his owner went to feed him . Both of his eyes had been gouged out , his stomach slit open , an ear cut off and his genitals removed .  Barney 's owner , 64-year-old Linda Vickerage , was unable to move his body straight away and left his corpse in the field where he was found .  Similar attack : A horse was found mutilated in Cornwall on Sunday , its genitalia removed , an eye cut out and teeth pulled out  She said : ` When I came home in the evening I thought there was something wrong . I went to the field with the torch , and to my horror I could clearly see he was dead .  ' I shined the torch on his face , his eyes had been pulled out and there was blood pouring from his abdomen .  ` You can see a knife has been deliberately used to open his guts , it 's done with almost surgical precision . '  In a bizarre twist , police believe Barney 's killer came back the following night and carried out further mutilations on the pony .  Ms Vickerage 's 38-year-old daughter Nicola is now offering a # 3,000 reward for information about the attack on Barney , which happened on her mother 's smallholding in Whitland , West Wales .  A Devon horse lover Graham Rickard has also offered a # 2,000 reward for information leading to the capture of the attacker .  Police are investigating the attack along with the RSPCA . One line of inquiry will be to see if someone has a grudge against the horse or his owner .  RSPCA spokesman Jo Barr said yesterday : ` This is a shocking incident and I can not imagine what would cause someone to carry out such a cowardly and barbaric act .  ' I would urge anyone with information to contact either the police or the RSPCA . '  St Winebald Day is traditionally a small Christian festival in December celebrating the work of its namesake St Winebald , who was an Anglo-Saxon Benedictine Abbot and Missionary , and led a seven year pilgrimage to Rome followed by a mission to Germany where he founded a monastery and Heidenheim .  In recent years , small Satanic groups have marked the St Winebald Day as January 7 , and associated the date with animal sacrifice .  The next marked date on the Satanic calendar is January 17 - known as the Satanic Revels - a Satanic day for sexual rituals .

139	In light of the brutal rape and murder of two British students holidaying in Thailand , an Australian woman claims that she nearly met the same fate .  Rather than staying on Koh Tao , the Melbourne woman was celebrating in Phuket after the wedding of a family member , The Sydney Morning Herald reported .

140	By Phil Vinter  PUBLISHED :  10:28 EST , 30 May 2012   |  UPDATED :  04:46 EST , 31 May 2012  They were nearly never built and suffered bomb damage in the Second World War but now for the first time in two centuries all the properties on one of Bath 's famous crescents are going on the market .  ` For Sale ' signs are set to go up on each of the 29 homes on the eye catching curve of Grade I listed buildings on Somerset Place in Bath .  It 's thought to be the first time since the strip was completed in the early 19th century that an entire crescent has been made available at the same time .  Clean sweep : The entire length of Grade One listed Somerset Place in Bath is going on sale . A single buyer could purchase the 29 homes at 17 addresses for a cool # 60million  The instantly recognisable architecture of the crescents are known around the world with thousands of tourists flocking to see the terraced properties every year .  In 2010 the most famous of them , the Royal Crescent , took second place in Google 's ` Britain 's Most Picturesque Street ' awards , beaten only by The Shambles in York .  Now the Bath office of estate agents Savills is marketing 29 homes at 17 addresses on the street which is going through a restoration project due for completion in 2014 .  Some of the nine individual five-storey townhouses are already on sale at between # 2million and # 3million , while there will also be 20 apartments created in the eight remaining properties .  Should agents Savills make just one per cent on the total sale of the 29 homes , expected to fetch at least # 50million they will make # 500,000 in commission alone .  Distinctive : Estate agents are beginning to market the entire stretch of Somerset Place in Bath which is going through a # 60million refit  Historic : Somerset Place , built between 1790 and 1820 and last used by Bath Spa University , was bought in February by the Strategic Iconic Assets Heritage Acquisition Fund  The interior of one of the houses at Somerset place show off the wooden floor and the floor-to-ceiling windows  A log fire adds to the ` dream home ' feeling of one of the houses on the crescent  Somerset Place , built between 1790 and 1820 and last used by Bath Spa University , was bought in February by the Strategic Iconic Assets Heritage Acquisition Fund .  Savills says : ` The crescent has survived as something of a time capsule , full of original Georgian plasterwork , fireplaces and original detailing , in need of sensitive restoration and modern comforts ' .  ` People with pockets deep enough to buy homes there will be able to call on a dedicated on-site concierge team , looking after the properties , gardens and what the agents describe as ` purchasers ' every need ' .  The apartments will range from ground floor maisonettes with gardens , to upper floor maisonettes with roof terraces .  Perfect properties : The apartments will range from ground floor maisonettes with gardens , to upper floor maisonettes with roof terraces  Architect 's drawing showing the separation between the different houses in Somerset Place . Numbers eight and nine , and 14 to 20 are all individual while all the others are maisonettes  These pictures display the interior of the houses where focus is heavy on art with paintings and sculptures  Luke Brady , from Savills , said : ` Somerset Place is a one-off . It 's rare that crescent properties come to the market and nowhere else offers you the choice of nine individual crescent houses with planning permission consented .  ` Purchasers looking to buy these at a developers finish will enjoy all the fun parts of designing a property with none of the headaches .  ` You could pay # 20 million for a crescent house in Notting Hill or # 2 million to # 3 million for one at Somerset Place , with 100ft private gardens , which I would consider great value for money . '  The City of Bath was inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 1987 and attracts more than one million tourists who book in to stay and another 3.8 million day visitors each year , drawn by its famous Roman spa baths .  The Georgians loved the regularity of Bath 's streets and squares and the contrast with adjacent rural nature , and the crescents were gradually built in response to the increasing number of visitors to the spa and resort town who required accommodation .  Architects John Wood the elder and his son John Wood the younger laid out the new quarters in streets and squares , the identical facades of which gave an impression of palatial scale and classical decorum .  Much of the creamy gold Bath Stone used for construction throughout the city was obtained from the limestone Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines , owned by Ralph Allen .  Allen , keen to show off his quarried limestone , commissioned the elder John Wood to build him a country house on his Prior Park estate between the city and the mines .  A many of more than one talent he was also responsible for improving and expanding the postal service in western England , for which he held the contract for over forty years .

Somerset Place was originally built between 1792 and 1800 with the initial idea to construct a much grander terrace of 20 houses .  A financial crash caused by the Napoleonic Wars at the turn of the 19th century meant funding dried up before the project was finished and only Numbers five to 20 were completed .  In 1784 author Thomas Paine bought an area of land including Great Lydes to build houses overlooking Bath , although there is also evidence of Iron Age and Roman settlement on the area .  During the heavy bombing of the city of Bath during the Bath blitz in 1942 , some sections of the strip were bombed .  Number 5 was completely destroyed and numbers 6 and 7 were so badly damaged that they had to be demolished for public safety .  Numbers 10 to 13 , spanning the centre of crescent were virtually destroyed , although the entire front facade remained standing .  Numbers 8 , 9 and 14 were also badly damaged and numbers 15 to 20 suffered slight damaged - all were repaired .  After the war , Bath Corporation bought the buildings for the Training College of Domestic Science , and Numbers 5 to 7 and 10 to 13 were rebuilt in the 1950s and 1960s , specifically as College facilities rather than as dwellings .  There are a variety of styles and structures inside . Bath Spa University later took over the buildings and modified them further for their own use .  The entire crescent is Grade I listed even though the buildings are a mix of originals and rebuilt properties .  Numbers 15 to 20 have the Georgian garden walls in place , but others do not .  There are some 1950s outbuildings along St Winifreds Lane and in the gardens behind Numbers 5 to 13 which look out of place alongside a Georgian crescent , and these too are part of the original scheme .

141	By Leon Watson  PUBLISHED :  15:27 EST , 28 November 2012   |  UPDATED :  03:04 EST , 29 November 2012  Violent death : Leah Whittle , 42 , was stabbed to death at her house . Her son , who can not be named for legal reasons , is appearing at court , charged with her murder  A 16-year-old boy murdered his mother by stabbing her 94 times , immobilising her early on in the attack by severing her spinal cord , a court heard today .  The teenager , who admits having ` an interest in knives ' , then claimed Leah Whittle had been killed at their home in Weymouth , Dorset , by a gang of ` mystery men from Yorkshire ' .  He inflicted knife wounds across her head , back and front in the two bedroom flat , stabbing her with at least one knife in an attack so sudden she had ` little chance ' to defend herself , jurors were told .  The teenager then fled the flat in the early hours , climbing out of his first floor bedroom window and down a drainpipe .  He went to visit friends , feeding them an elaborate cover story that he had seen a gang of ` mystery men ' from the north of England kill his mother , Winchester Crown Court heard .  Divorced mother-of-three Ms Whittle , 42 , was found slumped against the hallway wall .  Prosecutor Richard Smith said the teenager claimed he had watched through a bathroom doorway as other people stabbed his mother to death .  Mr Smith said : ` He described to friends how he had gone into the bathroom and from there was alerted by a noise to something happening outside .  ` The implication is that men had entered the flat and were trying to kill his own mother about a foot away from him .  ` He said he watched through the ajar door of the bathroom as `` they '' were stabbing his mother . And at some stage `` they '' tried to knife him . '  The youngster told friends of his ` escape ' when he met up with them shortly before 3am , Mr Smith said . They did not call the police or an ambulance .  In an earlier phone call , at around 10pm that evening , the boy had told a female friend in that group his mother would be executed and had ` days to live ' , Mr Smith said .  Mr Smith said : ` His brother had got himself into some sort of trouble with a drug debt or the like .  ` The boy announced that his mum had only got a couple of days to live . The friend was left with the impression that his mum 's life was at immediate risk .  ` Interest in knives ' : Winchester Crown Court heard the teenager turned on his mother , stabbing her in the head , back and front and then blaming mystery men from Yorkshire  ` Mystery people somehow concerned with his brother up in Doncaster were on their way or in someway likely to kill Ms Whittle . '  Tragically , the friend - who can not be named for legal reasons - could hear Ms Whittle in the background , bringing her son a drink .  Mr Smith added : ` Was he already in some sort of murderous mindset by this point ? Had he intended to take his own mother 's life and this gave him the welcome opportunity of a cover story ?  ` Exactly why it was that the defendant decided upon such a dreadful and genuinely tragic course of events perhaps will never be known . '  Prosecutor Richard Smith  ` Or having spoken with a teenage bravado , did something later on trigger his temper ? '  Either way , Ms Whittle was ` immobilised ' early on in an horrific killing at his hands , Mr Smith said . A blade wielded by her son severed her spinal cord , a post mortem of her bloodstained body revealed .  There were no injuries on her arms or hands , suggesting she was rendered unconscious early in the attack .  Today , the boy , now 17 , wore a silver tracksuit as he listened to his mother 's last moments being relived in court .  Mr Smith added : ` Exactly why it was that the defendant decided upon such a dreadful and genuinely tragic course of events perhaps will never be known .  ` It may well be that during the course of that night he had become angry at something she had said or done . He says for himself that he has a temper and perhaps that and his interest in knives came together and he took his mother 's life . '  Mr Smith told the jury that the youngster should have called 999 or screamed for help , or called an ambulance , but he did nothing but leave the flat .  He eventually went to a friend 's house with his mother 's blood on his face and on his socks , the court heard .  In the boy 's version of events , he must have stepped over his mother 's motionless body to lock the door after her killers left .  Then he took money from her handbag , changed his trousers and left through the window . He told his three friends - all girls - that cuts on his hands were from scaling down the drainpipe .  But forensics experts found traces of his blood inside the flat . The murder weapons have never been recovered .

142	Visitors to a wildlife park in New Zealand got to encounter a pride of lions up-close and personal .  Filmed at the Orana Wildlife Park -- the country 's only open-range zoo -- the video shows the lions interacting with the visitors who stand inside a metal cage attached to a car .  The video , which was captured by Ekant Veer , 35 , an associate professor at the University of Canterbury , also shows the lions scaling the cage and eating meat through its bars .  The lions at Orana Wildlife Park approach the metal cage and begin interacting with the people inside  Standing with its paws against the cage , a lion is introduced as Sakura who is around 11-years-old and weighs about 265kg .  As the keeper speaks , the lion licks at a piece of meat that is held up against the bars as another lion walks across the roof of the cage .  Looking down at the people below , the lion wanders around as if deciding who it would like to make its prey before staring down the lens of the camera .  Set tongues wagging ! One of the lions notices meat and begins sticking out its tongue in the hope of being fed  A lion stands next to one of the keepers and its large paw is the same size as the lady 's head  The people inside can be seen recording the many lions from their phones , while another -- with paws the same size as the keeper 's head -- holds itself up against the cage and chews on some meat .  Later in the video people can be seen pointing out the various felines as a keeper moves her hand along the cage , instigating the lion to follow .  Still frames capture a lion standing up against the side of the cage alongside the keeper -- its power and size is plain to see .  A keeper holds a piece of meat up to the bars of the cage and a lion follows her hand in the hope of receiving it  A number of lions are fed directly through the metal bars , while others receive meat dropped from the back of the cage  The car then begins driving away and the lions can be seen chasing after the people in the hope of receiving more food .  A keeper then drops meat from the back of it and the lions begin tailing off one by one with their own little piece of food .  The video concludes with one lion picking up a final lump of meat from the floor and being chased by another , angry feline .  A lion scales the cage and looks down at the people below as if deciding which one it would like to eat  The people inside can be seen pointing and filming the lion who wanders along the top of the cage above them  Orana Wildlife Park was opened in 1976 and is owned and operated by registered charity , Orana Wildlife Trust .  Located on the outskirts of Christchurch , the wildlife park is unique in that the people are caged in order to view the animals , not the other way around .

143	By Lillian Radulova  The search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean will continue for up to another year despite recent setbacks .  A new area of up to 800 kilometres long and 70 kilometres wide is expected to be selected for the new search zone . The Chinese survey ship Zhu Kezhen , has already begun mapping the new ocean floor and is expected to continue for the next three months .  The data collected by the ship , which is conducting a bathymetric survey , will determine if new search equipment can be safely towed to the area 's sea floor to search for the airline which went missing on March 8 carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew .  Scroll down for video  The search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 is expected to continue for at least the next 12 months , with Deputy prime minister Warren Truss declaring Australia is ` committed to the search '  It will also help determine water depths , enabling selection of scanning technology that will be needed for a fresh underwater search .  The previous two-month-long search for the airline drew doubts from US Navy sources earlier this week when the acoustic ` pings ' , which were at the centre of the search , were no longer believed to be coming from the aircraft 's black box .  The Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre confirmed that the previous search area was being abandoned on Thursday , and discounted as the resting place of the missing airline .  ` The Australian Transport Safety Bureau  ATSB  has advised that the search in the vicinity of the acoustic detections can now be considered complete and in its professional judgment , the area can now be discounted as the final resting place of MH370 , ' the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre said .  A Chinese survey ship has already begun mapping of the new ocean floor , expected to continue for the next three months  The Cinese ship Haixun 01  pictured  and a Malaysian vessel , Bunga Mas 6 , are assisting with transporting the survey data for further processing  In an interview with the ABC on Friday however , Deputy prime minister , Warren Truss , confirmed that the search would continue despite the revelations .  ` We remain as a nation committed to the search , we remain determined to do everything we possibly can to find this aircraft , ' he said .  ` It 's our responsibility to the families of those who are involved , but also to assure the safety of the flying public into the future . '  With the departure of Ocean Shield on Friday , the new search for the aircraft or any debris is anticipated to begin in August and take up to 12 months .  Possible rings of location : These areas were determined by measuring the time difference between communication messages sent between MH370 and an Inmarsat satellite  The Ocean Shield departed the previous search area on Friday after it was revealed that the acoustic ` pings ' whose data the search was based off , were unlikely to have been coming from the plane 's black-box  A contracted survey vessel is set to join the Chinese ship which is currently surveying the area alongside another Chinese ship Haixun 01 and a Malaysian vessel Bunga Mas 6 which are assisting with transporting the survey data for further processing .  Satellite , radar and and aircraft performance data also continue to be reviewed separately to determine where the plane was most likely to have hit the water .  Seven of the so called ` handshake ' signals sent by the plane to an Inmarsat satellite will be reanalyzed , as they are now determined to be the best indication of the planes final location points .  The Inmarsat control room . The British satellite firm 's data , which contains signals sent by MH370 will be reanalyzed  Australian search authorities narrowed the search for the jet after picking up a series of pings near where analysis of satellite data put the last location of the Boeing 777 , some 1,600 km off Australia 's northwest coast  The discovery of the pings on April 5 and 8 was hailed as a significant breakthrough , leading Australian search authorities to narrow the search for the jet to some 1,600 km off Australia 's northwest coast .  But according to Michael Dean , the US Navy 's deputy director of ocean engineering , authorities now almost universally believe the pings did not come from the onboard data or cockpit voice recorders .  He believes the pings instead came from some other man-made source unrelated to the jetliner which disappeared on March 8 carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew .  Speaking to CNN , Mr Dean said : ` Our best theory at this point is that  the pings were  likely some sound produced by the ship ... or within the electronics of the Towed Pinger Locator . '  850 square kilometres of the ocean floor were scoured in search of the airline , but no sign of wreckage and no debris linked to the plane has ever been picked up despite the most extensive and expensive search effort in aviation history .  Authorities have not ruled out mechanical problems as a cause but say the evidence , including the loss of communications , suggests it was deliberately diverted thousands of kilometres from its scheduled route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing .

144	By David Wilkes  Packed up neatly , the Princess Mary gift boxes were all ready to be sent to the Tommies in the trenches 100 years ago .  But the cardboard carton containing 80 embossed brass tins in packs of eight was never sent to the Western Front and they remained unopened -- until now .  Fittingly , the honour of snipping the string tied round the carton and opening the tins for the first time in a century fell to Lady Emma Kitchener , great-great-niece of Lord Kitchener of Khartoum , the then Secretary of State for War whose mustachioed face and pointing hand were made famous on Britain 's best known First World War recruitment poster .  Family : The gift boxes , intended for the trenches were opened at the Daily Mail Chalke Valley History Festival in Whiltshire , by Lady Emma Kitchener , posing with a poster of her ancestor  His face gazed down from one of only four known surviving originals of that poster as Lady Kitchener -- with her husband Julian Fellowes , creator of Downton Abbey , by her side -- literally lifted the lid on these poignant pieces of history .  Lady Kitchener agreed to open them at the Daily Mail Chalke Valley History Festival at an event staged by Onslows auctioneers .  The carton was found in Ireland where it was part of a private collection of Great War memorabilia .  Princess Mary , daughter of King George V , started a Sailors and Soldiers Christmas Fund in November 1914 to give those wearing the King 's uniform and serving overseas on Christmas Day 1914 a ` gift from the nation ' .  At the time , it was expected the war would be over by early 1915 .  History box : The 80 embossed Princess Mary brass tins were found to contain a pencil made from a .303 shell case and a printed note from Princess Mary  Previous examples of the tins have contained cigarettes , boiled sweets , chocolate and a pencil made from a .303 shell case along with a printed note reading : ` With best wishes for a victorious New Year from the Princess Mary and friends at home . '  Those opened at the festival in Wiltshire on Saturday only contained the pen and note .  Experts said other items would have been added later to suit individual recipients -- for example , non-smokers would get sweets rather than cigarettes . It is not known why the carton was never sent .  After opening the boxes , Lady Kitchener , a former lady-in-waiting to Princess Michael of Kent , told the Mail : ` It was really extraordinary -- a really , really moving experience , and I was tremendously honoured , and humbled actually , at doing such a thing .  ` The smell as I opened them was a mixture of sawdust and damp ... and funnily enough , Julian said , of his grandmother 's drawing room . '  She added : ` It was perhaps the very first time the soldiers who received these boxes were away from home ... to be in the trenches in all that discomfort and being so frightened , you ca n't imagine what that was like .  ` So to get a little present like that from Princess Mary was thrilling and I 'm sure unexpected as well . '  Patrick Bogue , of Onslows , said the boxes would be offered for sale for # 300 each , with 10 per cent of proceeds going to military charities .  Mr Bogue added that he had thought there were only three of the Kitchener recruitment posters -- until Lady Kitchener remarked that she had one too . .

145	By John Stevens  PUBLISHED :   13:05 EST , 15 January 2014    | UPDATED :   19:59 EST , 15 January 2014  A gang of Eastern Europeans were yesterday found guilty of subjecting girls as young as 12 to horrific sexual abuse .  Two adults and three boys were convicted of rape and sexual assault in what prosecutors described as one of the worst cases they had ever seen .  A court heard how the group , of Czech , Slovak and Kurdish origin , groomed five vulnerable girls between 12 and 14 and then abused them in a range of locations , including near a playground , in 2012 .  Zdeno Mirga and Hassan Abdulla , who were both convicted of rape  Eighteen-year-old Zdeno Mirga , described by one girl as the ` boss ' , was convicted of eight counts of rape and one count of inciting child prostitution following a trial at the Old Bailey . One of his victims told how Mirga would take her to parties and ` share ' her for money to buy vodka and cannabis .  Angela Rafferty , prosecuting , told the court : ` He encouraged her , often very forcefully indeed , to give others sex . He did this using the power he had over her at the time , or threatened her , and sometimes he used violence against her . '  A child sex gang has been found guilty at the Old Bailey of a series of rapes against five vulnerable girls  Hassan Abdulla , 33 , was convicted of four rapes and three counts of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity . Two boys , who can not be named for legal reasons , were convicted of various counts of rape and sexual assault . A third was found guilty of sexual activity with a child , but cleared of rape .  The Crown Prosecution Service said the case was one of the worst examples of child sex abuse it had ever seen . The court had earlier heard how a 13-year-old victim was forced to perform sex acts on up to ten attackers in a park as one urged : ` Rape her . '  A team of interpreters were brought in to work on the case , which lasted two and a half months . Judge John Bevan QC said : ` Because some of the defendants do not speak good enough English , despite having lived here a long time , three interpreters have worked full time during this case , at a cost of over # 30,000 . '  The judge will sentence the gang , from Peterborough , on February 20 .  Speaking after yesterday 's verdicts , detective superintendent Gary Ridgway of Cambridgeshire Police said : ` These girls were targeted simply because they were vulnerable . They were seen as easy targets and exploited by this group of teenage boys and men who abused them for their own sexual gratification .  ` The victims , who were as young as 12 , were subjected to horrific ordeals . But they have shown incredible strength throughout this process -- in particular by giving evidence at court in order to bring these people to justice . We are committed to helping those girls pick up the pieces and move on with their lives . '  The Home Affairs Select committee has called on the Government to introduce special courts to ensure child sex attackers are brought to justice . It discovered that some victims found the trial of their abusers more harrowing than their crimes , following marathon cross-examinations by teams of aggressive defence barristers .  Investigation : Peterborough City Council said it had called for a serious case review  The latest case comes after seven Oxford men , mostly of Pakistani heritage , were convicted at the Old Bailey last year of running a paedophile sex ring . That trial had followed another , almost exactly 12 months earlier , concerning nine Asian men based in Rochdale .  Peterborough has seen a sizeable influx of immigrants in the past ten years , leading to racial tensions in the city . The 2011 census revealed that only 70.9 per cent of the population was white British , compared with 85.7 per cent ten years earlier .  In 2001 , shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks , 17-year-old Ross Parker was murdered by a group of Muslim youths in the city , in what the judge described at the trial as a ` racist killing ' .

A hotelier couple are giving away their 14-bedroom Essex resort in a prize draw after running the business for 18 years .  Owners Gordon and Blossom Hoyles and the Hotel Continental , in Dovercourt , appeared on Channel 4 show Four In A Bed in 2012 , raising eyebrows at the time for their taste in erotic art .  Yours for a grand : The owners of Hotel Continental in Dovercourt , Essex , are giving away the hotel in a prize draw - tickets cost # 1,000  While terms and conditions are still being ironed out , it will cost # 1,000 for a ticket to be entered into the prize draw .  The decision to sell the property in such an unusual way came in an early morning burst of inspiration after the couple were told that it would take two years to sell the property in the current market .  ` One morning I woke up at 3.30 am , went to the bar and said to our night porter I would raffle the hotel , ' 78-year-old Mr Hoyles said .  ' I started to look into it and found we could do it as a prize draw . We got a solicitor and started putting it together .  TV stars : Gordon and Blossom Hoyles appeared on Channel 4 show Four in a Bed in 2012  ` Blossom and I think it 's time for a change . I have n't got that much time to spare and I do n't want to be arguing over conveyancing trifles at 80 plus .  ` Going might be a bit traumatic - a bit painful , but having decided to go we want to go quickly .  ` It seems a good thing to give the winner an instant , exciting , life-changing , lucky day . '  Gordon and Blossom showed off the Hotel Continental on Four In A Bed two years ago .  The show sees hoteliers spend a night in a rival B&B s , paying how much they believe the room is worth .  Every room is described k as ` unique and deliberately different ' , with prices starting at # 35 a night .  The Dry Dock room looks like a ship 's cabin with a stained glass porthole design window .  Room eight is described as : ' A bit refined , a bit masculine . Sturdy oak . '  There is also a family room with a double bed and bunk beds . Some rooms are decorated with racy wallpaper , unusual artwork and bespoke furniture .  The hotel , which overlooks Dovercourt Bay , has a bar , 24-cover restaurant and terrace garden .  The Hoyles hope the tickets could start being sold within a month .  New business venture ? Rooms start from # 35 a night at the 14-bedroom hotel  It is still being discussed whether there will need to be a minimum number of tickets sold for the sale to go ahead .  However , it can not be called a lottery or a raffle as a lottery can not be held for private financial gain and raffles have a prize limit so both would be illegal .  Gordon and Blossom hope to visit Mr Hoyles ' daughter in Australia , take a well-earned holiday and possibly move to France .

151	By David Martosko , U.s. Political Editor  PUBLISHED :   12:47 EST , 7 February 2014    | UPDATED :   17:00 EST , 7 February 2014  The White House does n't like it , and neither does a prominent Senate Republican , but Olympic athletes who win medals in Sochi will have to pay federal income taxes on their cash bonuses .  The U.S. Olympic Committee awards $ 25,000 for each gold medal , $ 15,000 for silver and $ 10,000 for bronze . But top athletes who are in the top income tax bracket , 39.6 per cent , will have to fork over as much as $ 9,900 of a gold medal payout .  Competitors in Sochi , Russia will be able to deduct their expenses that are n't covered by the Olympic Committee or their others sponsors , but there may be additional taxes levied by states and cities on top of what Uncle Sam takes .  And adding insult to injury , any precious metals in their medals will also be taxed . The Sochi gold medals will be worth $ 566 , and contain mostly silver .  The could drive the total federal tax liability for a gold medal winner north of $ 10,000 .  All hail the Olympic taxpayers ! Any valuable Americans win in Sochi , and the cash bonuses that come with them , will be subject to hefty federal income taxes  Magic : The Sochi Winter Olympics are underway , and as the u.S. medal count rises , so will Uncle Sam 's take of the proceeds  In 2012 Florida Senator Marco Rubio introduced legislation that would exempt Olympic athletes from paying income taxes on their bonuses . The White House said at the time that President Obama supported the measure .  ` Our tax code is a complicated and burdensome mess that too often punishes success , and the tax imposed on Olympic medal winners is a classic example of this madness , ' said Rubio when he introduced the Olympic Tax Elimination Act .  ` Athletes representing our nation overseas in the Olympics should n't have to worry about an extra tax bill waiting for them back home . '  A Rubio spokesman told MailOnline that the Republican lawmaker has n't reintroduced the bill since the end of the last Congress .  But some House Republicans , led by Texas Rep. Blake Fahrenthold , have launched a similar effort , he said , and ` we 're seeing how the effort proceeds in that chamber . '  Fahrenthold filed his bill on Wednesday , saying that ` this needless tax illustrates how complicated and burdensome our tax code has become . We need a fairer system for all , and eliminating this unnecessary tax burden on our athletes is a good way to start . '  White House Press Secretary Jay Carney signaled the president 's enthusiasm for Rubio 's measure in August 2012 when a reporter asked about it .  ` The president believes that we should support efforts -- like , I think , the bill you 're referencing -- to ensure that we are doing everything we can to honor and support our Olympic athletes who have volunteered to represent our nation at the Olympic Games . So he supports that bill . If it were to get to his desk , he would support it . '  Smile : You 're not American : British cyclists won gold in London , but they 'd be faced with a big tax bill if they were part of Team USA  Not that kind of ring , so no new taxes : The presentation of the Olympic rings was part of the opening ceremony in Sochi , Russia on Friday -- but the fifth ring failed to light up  Americans for Tax Reform , an anti-tax crusader group in Washington led by conservative firebrand Grover Norquist , publicized the Olympic medal taxes on Friday with the suggestion that the U.S. should stop taxing all money earned overseas .  ` Because the U.S. is one of only a handful of developed countries that tax income earned abroad , it is likely America 's competitors will not be subject to such a tax , ' the group said in a statement .

152	By Ruth Styles  PUBLISHED :  06:49 EST , 12 June 2013   |  UPDATED :  18:37 EST , 12 June 2013  The 1,082 ft cruise ship set to be named by the Duchess of Cambridge has been unveiled ahead of today 's launch with a set of images that reveal the lavish interior and impressive rooms of the multimillion pound boat .  Named the Royal Princess , the latest ship to be built by Princess Cruises certainly lives up to its regal name .  Due to be launched in a traditional naming ceremony , the spectacular cruiser has everything the well-heeled guest could possibly want , including a fully-equipped games room , casino and a spa .  The Royal Princess also has a 28ft glass-bottomed viewing gallery , 10 different restaurants including one that specialises in steak and lobster , and 1,780 luxury staterooms .

Despite the ship 's regal name , the vessel was not named after the Duchess of Cambridge . Instead , the name was taken from the original Royal Princess ship which launched in 1984 and is no longer in service .  ` Appointing a godmother to name a new ship is one of maritime 's oldest traditions , ' said Paul Ludlow , UK Director of Princess Cruises .  ` Historically their role is to be entrusted with the safe guidance of a vessel and its passengers . We are thrilled to welcome HRH Duchess of Cambridge , godmother to Royal Princess , to Southampton and look forward to celebrating this historic occasion .

153	The U.S. official in charge of assessing the damage caused by the leaking of classified document by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden said earlier this week that making a deal to grant Snowden amnesty in exchange for the documents he still has is something worth considering .  Richard Ledgett , who was put in charge of the Snowden leak task-force by General Keith Alexander , was interviewed for an upcoming episode of 60 Minutes , and says that because of the damage Snowden could potentially do with the information he still has in his possession , cutting him a deal might be in the best interest of the country .  ` So , my personal view is , yes , -LSB- granting Snowden amnesty -RSB- is worth having a conversation about , ' Ledgett tells 60 Minutes corespondent John Miller . ' I would need assurances that the remainder of the data could be secured , and my bar for those assurances would be very high . It would be more than just an assertion on his part . '  Richard Ledgett , who heads a task force assessing Snowden 's leaks , says the U.S. should consider granting him amnesty  In all , Ledgett says Snowden is likely to still be in possession of more than 1.5 million classified documents as he waits in asylum in Russia .  Ledgett 's boss , General Alexander , does n't share his belief that Snowden should be allowed to evade punishment for stealing the documents .  ` This is analogous to a hostage-taker taking 50 people hostage , shooting 10 and then say , `` If you give me full amnesty , I 'll let the other 40 go . '' What do you do , ' Alexander says .  Meanwhile , the NSA has made dozens of changes in its operations and computer networks to prevent the emergence of another Snowden , including potential disciplinary action , a top NSA official said on Friday , as a White House review panel recommended restraints on NSA spying .  In the more than hour-long interview with Reuters , Ledgett acknowledged the agency had done a poor job in its initial public response to revelations of vast NSA monitoring of phone and Internet data ; pledged more transparency ; and said he was deeply worried about highly classified documents not yet public that are among the 1.7 million Snowden is believed to have accessed .  He also stoutly defended the NSA 's mission of tracking terrorist plots and other threats , and said its recruiting of young codebreakers , linguists and computer geeks has not been affected by the Snowden affair - even as internal morale has been .  ` Any time you trust people , there is always a chance that someone will betray you , ' he said .  Bargaining Chip : Authorities say Snowden still has 1.5 million classified documents in his possession  The NSA is taking 41 specific technical measures to control data by tagging and tracking it , to supervise agency networks with controls on activity , and to increase oversight of individuals .  Measures include requiring two-person control of every place where someone could access data and enhancing the security process that people go through and requiring more frequent screenings of systems administrative access , Ledgett said .  After months of sometimes blistering criticism in the news media and by Congress and foreign governments , the publicity-averse NSA is now mounting an effort to tell its side of the Snowden story .  Ledgett , a 36-year intelligence veteran who reportedly is in line to be the agency 's deputy director , joked that doing media interviews was ' a complete out-of-body experience for me . '  He spoke to Reuters on the same day that the White House said it had decided to maintain the practice of having a single individual head both the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command , which conducts cyberwarfare - an outcome the NSA leadership favored .  Separately , news reports late Thursday said an outside review panel appointed by the White House has recommended changes in a program disclosed by Snowden that collects basic data on Americans ' phone calls - known as metadata .  The panel reportedly said the data should be held by an organization other than the NSA and stricter rules should be enforced for searching the databanks .  Asylum : Snowden remains in asylum in Russia , where he is in possession of more than 1.5 million classified documents  Ledgett declined to discuss the panel 's specific recommendations . But he seemed to acknowledge that tighter guidelines for NSA eavesdropping were in the offing , saying that what is technologically possible `` has gotten ahead of policy . ''  Snowden , who is living under asylum in Russia , disclosed a vast U.S. eavesdropping apparatus that includes the phone metadata program ; NSA querying of Internet communications via major companies such as Google Inc and Facebook Inc ; and widespread tapping of international communication networks .  Ledgett made no apologies for what many see as overly aggressive NSA monitoring . He noted that the U.S. government 's intelligence taskings to the agency run to 36,000 pages , and said its activities take place within a ` box ' of U.S. laws and policies . ` We 'll color in every square millimeter of that box , ' he said , implying the NSA will use its legal authorities to the fullest extent possible .  The NSA 's internal review has determined about 98 percent of the scope of the material that Snowden had accessed , and officials have found no evidence that he had help either within the NSA or from adversary spy agencies .  Ledgett said that when Snowden was downloading the documents , NSA was ahead of other intelligence agencies in installing `` insider threat '' software that President Barack Obama ordered in the wake of an earlier leak scandal involving the group WikiLeaks . But installation of the software , which might have stopped Snowden , was not complete .  ` Snowden hit at a really opportune time . For him - not for us , ' he said .  Not Unanimous : General Keith Alexander does n't agree that Snowden should be granted amnesty in exchange for documents  Ledgett said that most of the Snowden material released publicly so far has been about NSA programs and partnerships with foreign countries and companies , rather than intelligence reports and ` requirements . ' The latter refers to U.S. government taskings to the NSA to answer questions about specific targets .  That last category is what keeps him up at night . ` Those make me nervous because they reveal what we know and what we do n't know and they are almost a roadmap for adversaries . '  No one at the NSA has yet lost their job over the Snowden crisis , including at the Hawaii site where he worked . Ledgett said three people are under review for potential disciplinary action , but declined further comment .  He challenged those who call Snowden a whistleblower , saying the former contractor did not use multiple channels available to vent his concerns . ' I actually think characterizing him as a whistleblower is a disservice to people who are whistleblowers . '  Ledgett said he knew of no U.S. government move toward reaching any kind of a legal deal with Snowden , a decision that would be up to the Justice Department .  But , he said in his opinion , such a conversation would have to include concrete assurances that Snowden would secure any of the material he has that has not yet been made public .  In the aftermath of Snowden , the NSA is trying to be more open about what it does so the public can have more confidence in the agency 's mission .  ` We as an agency are a little naive , for a long time we were '' No Such Agency '' or '' no comment '' and were not adept at presenting our face to the public , ' he said . ' I think quite frankly had we done more of that over the last five or 10 years we might not be in the same place that we are vis-a-vis the public perception of who we are and what we do , ' he said . ` So too late to learn that lesson , so what you are seeing now is our new face .

155	By Ben Spencer  Scientists have discovered the first new river dolphin species in almost 100 years .  They have named the new breed , which is only the fifth river dolphin species in the world , ` Araguaia ' , after the Brazilian river where it was found .  Writing in the journal Plos One , the researchers say the new species , the first discovered since 1918 , diverged from other South American river species more than two million years ago .  Scientists have named the breed , which is only the fifth river dolphin species in the world , ¿ Araguaia ¿ ,  pictured  after the Brazilian river where it was found . It is the first new species of river dolphin discovered since 1918  They estimate there are 1,000 of the creatures living in the Araguaia river basin .  River dolphins are incredibly rare . Out of the five species , three are on the critically endangered Red List , and the scientists believe the Araguaia dolphins should join them .  They tend to have long beaks which let them hunt for fish in the mud at the bottom of rivers , unlike the short-nosed sea dolphins .  Dr Tomas Hrbek , from the Federal University of Amazonas , said : ` It was something that was very unexpected , it is an area where people see them all the time , they are a large mammal , the thing is nobody really looked .

Out of the five species , three are on the critically endangered Red List , and the scientists believe the Araguaia dolphins  skulls pictured  should join them . They tend to have long beaks which let them hunt for fish in the mud at the bottom of rivers  The closest relation to the new breed , the Amazon or pink river dolphin , is said to be the most intelligent of all the river species .  The scientists say there are some differences in the number of teeth and they suspect the Araguaia river species is smaller , but most of the clues to the difference were found in their genes .  Dr Hrbek said the dolphins are at risk because they clash with local fishermen .  ` The dolphins are at the top of the line , they eat a lot of fish , ' he said .  ` They rob fishing nets so the fishermen tend to not like them , people shoot them .

157	By Anna Hodgekiss for MailOnline  A Chinese farmer left with a large chunk missing from his skull is to have it repaired with the help of a 3D printer .  The man , known only as 46-year-old Hu , was injured after falling from the third floor of his home in Xi'an , Shaanxi province .  Doctors are now planning to re-build his skull with a titanium mesh created by a 3D printer .  The man , known only as 46-year-old Hu , was injured after falling from the third floor of his home in Xi'an  Doctors are now planning to re-build his skull with a titanium mesh created by a 3D printer  The custom-made implant will be inserted under Hu 's skin and attached to his skull .  If the procedure is successful , doctors say the mesh will restore the original shape of his head .  Last week surgeons in China successfully implanted an artificial 3D-printed vertebra into a 12-year-old bone cancer patient to help him walk again .  Doctors at Peking University Hospital in Beijing first removed a tumour located in the second vertebra of the boy 's neck .  They then replaced it with the 3D-printed implant between the first and third vertebrae to allow him to lift his head .  The five-hour surgery was a world first and will enable the boy named Minghao to walk again after spending two months confined to a hospital bed .  While 3D-printed organs are not yet commonly used , there have been previous cases of patients being implanted with 3D-printed jaws , hips and even a pelvis .  ` This is the first use of a 3D-printed vertebra as an implant for orthopaedic spine surgery in the world , ' Dr Liu Zhongjun , who performed the surgery , told Chinese media CCTV .  The custom-made implant will be inserted under Hu 's skin and attached to his skull .  If the procedure is successful , doctors say the titanium mesh will restore the original shape of his head .  Using existing technology , the patient 's head needs to be framed with pins after surgery . The patient 's head can not touch the bed when he is resting . This lasts for at least three months , ' Dr Liu said .  ` But with 3D printing technology , we can simulate the shape of the vertebra , which is much stronger and more convenient than traditional methods , ' said Dr Liu Zhongjun , who performed the surgery  And last year , British surgeons used 3D printing technology to recreate the severely injured face of a road accident victim .  The unaffected side of the biker 's face was used to create a mirror image , to enable perfect facial reconstruction .  The images are were both to design guides to cut and position facial bones with pinpoint accuracy and create tailor-made implants for the patient .  The guides and implants were produced in medical-grade titanium in Belgium , at one of the world 's few specialist 3D printing facilities .

159	Eerie photos have emerged of hundreds of retired aircraft parked in rows and set formations in aviation graveyards across America .  The ` boneyards ' in Arizona , California and New Mexico are home to hundreds of retired commercial and military aircraft that are stored in the dry desert conditions to prevent them from going rusty .  Boeing , McDonnell Douglas , Lockheed and Airbus store planes at these bases , with the hope the planes will fly again . However many are eventually scrapped or used for spare parts .  Scroll down for video  Commercial aircraft sit on the tarmac at the Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville , California . In the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks , the airline industry suffered a drop in revenue which resulted in many older airplanes being taken out of service and grounded  There are 11 major bases across the U.S. that are used to store retired planes , yet these images are taken from largest and most densely populated bases .  These are the Pinal Airpark in Marana and the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group  AMARG  at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson , Arizona , California 's Southern Logistics Airport in Victorville and the Mojave Air & Space Port , and the Roswell International Air Center in Roswell , New Mexico .  The Pinal Airpark is a public-use airport in Pinal County , Arizona , around seven miles from the central business district of Marana .  The Airpark is mainly used as a ` boneyard ' for commercial planes , and old airplanes are stored there with the hope that the desert climate will stop them from rusting .  Pinal Airpark covers an area of 2,080 acres and has single runway measuring 6,849 by 150 feet .  The Southern California Logistics Airport is a public airport located in the city of Victorville in San Bernardino County . The facility was George Air Force Base between 1941 to 1992 and was used as a front-line United States Air Force base  An intact T-33 Shooting Star aircraft sits in the shadows of a dismantled B-47 Stratojet aircraft at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center in Tucson , Arizona . More than 2,500 aircraft from all services are stored at the centre . Most of the aircraft are used for parts , returned to service , sold to foreign governments or donated to federal and state agencies  The Airpark is used as a parachute testing and training facility and in March Navy SEAL SCPO Brett Shadle was killed during parachute training at the facility , and another SEAL was injured .  At the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base there are more than $ 35billion  # 22billion  worth of outdated planes kept as spare parts for current models .  The base was named after Lieutenants Samuel H. Davis and Oscar Monthan who died in military aircraft accidents during the First World War .  This shot is an aerial image of the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group  AMARG  located on the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona . AMARG has approximately $ 35 billion  # 22 billion  worth of aircraft , totalling around 4,500 planes , from all of various commercial and military companies  The planes in AMARG are used to replace more than 350,000 spare parts for active planes including engines , munitions , wiring and electronics .  Some planes are stored at the base between deployments but for more than 80 per cent of the 4,500 aircraft kept there are for parts .  Current military planes stored at the base include an intact T-33 Shooting Star aircraft and dismantled B-47 Stratojet aircraft .  Staff at the facility recycle , on average , more than 19,000 parts worth $ 568million  # 366million  and the U.S. government allows the military in other countries to buy parts and planes from the site .  Major aircraft carriers in the U.S store dozens of passenger planes at the 5,000-acre former Air Force base in Victorville , California . The planes are mix of retired planes and planes that have been temporarily discontinued due to budget constraints . The airport was used in films such as The Sum of All Fears  2002  and Jarhead  2003   The facility is the size of 1,300 football pitches and it was used in films such as The Sum of All Fears from 2002 and Jarhead in 2003 .

Consensual adults involved in mutual drug usage . It went wrong but it was n't intended . '  Biggam also called on police to release the full surveillance video taken from the boat , which prosecutors are using as evidence for a number of allegations .  The footage allegedly shows Tichelman injecting Hayes before watching him die then finishing her glass of wine and stepping over the body .  She then spends time researching legal strategies online , police claim , before gathering her belongings to leave , hours before Hayes was found dead .  Police have berated Tichelman for appearing to make no effort to call 911 in the video described .  Her defense team has only seen 20 minutes of the footage described in court but Biggam insists it shows the overdose was ` accidental ' .  She now faces eight charges which all carry 15-year jail terms , including manslaughter , prostitution , destroying evidence and several related to administering and possessing heroin .  The next hearing is scheduled for December 5 .  Accusations : Police claim a surveillance video shows Tichelman watching Hayes die before stepping over him  On board : Tichelman 's lawyers want police to release a surveillance video taken from the Santa Cruz yacht where Hayes was found which they claim proves it was an accidental , consensual overdose of heroin  Tichelman , who met her clients through a website called Seeking Arrangement , had exchanged texts and emails with Hayes and met with him a few times before the deadly November 26 encounter .  That day , they met on Hayes ' 50-foot yacht , Escape , at the Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor and Tichelman brought heroin before injecting him with the drug , police said .  Authorities launched a nine-month investigation into the incident before eventually uncovering Tichelman 's correspondence with the victim .  They then tracked her down to her home in Folsom , where she lives with her parents , but lured her back to Santa Cruz County by posing as a client who said he wanted to pay her $ 1,000 for sex . She agreed to meet at a luxury hotel on Fourth of July and was arrested .  She was booked into jail on suspicion of second-degree murder , concealing evidence and transportation of narcotics and remains there on a $ 1.5 million bond .  Hayes , who was originally from Dearborn , Michigan was married for 17 years to wife Denise and together they had five children , according to his obituary .  He worked in the auto industry before senior roles at Apple and Google .  ` Forrest will be remembered above all as a loving husband and father . More than anything else he enjoyed spending time with his family at home and on his boat , ' according to a January obituary .  ` His brilliant mind , contagious smile and warm embrace will be missed and cherished in memories by his friends and family . '  Tichelman 's Facebook profile shows she went to high school in Atlanta before majoring in journalism at Georgia State University and attending beauty school . She lists her occupation as a makeup artist .  She called herself a ` model ' in jail records .  On social media , she poses in lingerie and pouts with red lips for the camera .  Charges : Tichelman is facing up to 15 years for eight charges including manslaughter and prostitution  Lured : She was arrested after law enforcement officers posed as a client and lured her to a Santa Cruz hotel  In an interview with fiXE fETISH magazine , she said she loved modeling because she got to play a character .  ' I have always been attracted to the darker side , ' she said . ` My parents said by the time I was three I was an `` intense child '' and already liked horror movies . '  She added that she loved fetishism and would often wear a leash when she went out with her boyfriend .  She also posted pictures under another Facebook profile , AK Kennedy , and talks about heroin and her love of the serial killer TV show , ` Dexter ' .  Seeking Arrangement , the website through which Tichelman and Hayes met , is described as being a site for connecting ` sugar babies ' with ` sugar daddies and mommas ' - but the company maintains it is not promoting prostitution .    	  Alex Tichelman , 26 , ` injected father-of-five Forrest Hayes , 51 , with heroin last November but did nothing when he had a reaction to the drug '    Her lawyers Monday insisted she was told to administer the lethal shot    They claim surveillance footage on the yacht shows it was accidental    Police disagree , claiming she ` watches him die then steps over the body '    Instead of calling 911 , ` she gathered her belongings , finished her wine and left ' - leaving the boat 's captain to find his body the next day    Cops caught Tichelman by posing as a client , arrested her in hotel room	The high-priced prostitute accused of killing a Google executive by injecting him with heroin claims she was simply following orders .

162	Gordon Greer was surprised to hear Robert Lewandowski complaining about his robust challenge in Scotland 's 2-2 draw against Poland last month .  The 33-year-old Brighton defender made his competitive debut in the European Championship qualifier in Warsaw and after 10 minutes left the Bayern Munich star in agony with a tackle described afterwards by Lewandowski as ` brutal ' .

164	This creepy footage shows a decaying mall overwhelmed by mold and rampant plantlife - just six months after it closed its doors .  It shows the Jamestown Mall in St Louis , Missouri , which closed for good in July 2014 after being declared ` blighted ' by local authorities .  An unidentified explorer made his way inside the complex , and finds his way through old stores , into the bowels of the building and through decaying sales displays from its heyday .  Scroll down for video  Creepy : The Jamestown Mall in St Louis , Missouri , is now overgrown and dark  Close-up : An explorer made his way inside the complex and posted torchlit footage of what he found  Decay Lauder : Product displays from inside one of the mall 's stores were surrounded by broken glass  Moldering : This once-purple cinema carpet is now covered in green growths  And while much of the building seems to be untouched , the man , whose path was lit only by a head torch , found a bed and pillow inside , suggesting at least on person has made the mall their home .  While the last stores in the complex stayed open into last year , according to Fox 2 St Louis , by that time many had already been closed for years .  Many areas visited in the footage seemed to show their age - a movie theater , which had mold growing from the carpets , was displaying posters for movies from the summer of 2008 .  Other seemingly out-of-place features were a room full of developed film photographs , and stacks of 90s-style cathode ray televisions in a back room .  Clues ? It is unclear how long all the parts of the mall were closed for - but these cinema posters show movies from 2008  Old-school : Among the finds inside the store was a stash of 90-style cathode ray television sets  Not quite empty ? The explorer even found a mattress and pillow inside the mall - suggesting it has n't been completely vacated  The footage , uploaded to Youtube in December , passes through shops and corridors , which have received remarkably little vandalism , which usually strikes abandoned places soon after they are closed down .  The explorer , who is not identified , warns anybody watching that they could be arrested and charged for trespass in the eerie complex .  He also wrote that the power and alarm systems in the mall are still functional - although at least one alarmed door he pushed in the course of the video did not appear to respond .  The unknown posters appears to be part of the urban exploration community - explorers who often dodge authorities to investigate abandoned places , and show off their footage and photographs online .

165	Derek Llambias has opened up the possibility of Kenny McDowall remaining in charge of Rangers beyond the end of the season .  The new Ibrox chief executive addressed the managerial situation at Monday 's tempestuous Annual General Meeting .  Ally McCoist was placed on gardening leave on Sunday evening , nine days after notifying the club hierarchy of his intent to step down at the end of a 12-month notice period .  Ally McCoist left Rangers nine days after he offered his resignation to the Glasgow club  Assistant McDowall was then named as interim manager for the current campaign , with coaching support provided by Ian Durrant and Gordon Durie as Rangers seek to close the gap on runaway Championship leaders Hearts .  And while the bleak financial situation continues to cloud the future at Ibrox , Llambias had words of backing for McDowall .  ` When Ally handed in his notice , it was a surprise to us , ' said Llambias . ` He felt he had done his time and needed to move on . He was willing to work his notice .  ` We needed time to reflect on that decision and do what was best for the club . We said we 'd come back to Ally and it was business as usual because we had a game at the weekend .  McDowall will be in charge of Rangers until at least the end of the season  ` We spoke to Ally last night and decided it was better that we took this opportunity to put Ally on gardening leave . It would give him time to reflect and spend time at home and for us to reorganise the coaching staff .  ` We all have to move forward . Ally has been a great ambassador for the club , he has done a great job for the club and brought through some good youth players . But it is Ally 's choice to leave , not ours .  ` When somebody makes a choice to leave in that position in football , we all have to move on . We have to respect what Ally has done and respect what the club is trying to do now .  ` We are going to give Kenny 100 per cent support . He is going to be in place until the end of the season - and maybe beyond . '  Llambias had earlier used his opening address at the meeting to outline why he believes his previous five-year stint running Newcastle United makes him the right man to drag Rangers out of their current plight .  Derek Llambias has opened up the possibility of McDowall remaining in charge of Rangers permanently  Initially appointed as a non-executive director in the wake of the board accepting a # 2million loan from Mike Ashley in late October , Llambias was elevated to the post of chief executive last Friday .  ` I am honoured to have been appointed as the new chief executive of Rangers , ' he said . ` As you can imagine , it has been a very up and down experience over the past few days -- to say the least .  ` But I am now going to be in a position to roll up my sleeves and get on with the hard work it will take to get this club back onto its own two feet .  ` I have a strong track record in business and football . I spent the early part of my career in leisure before being appointed as managing director of Newcastle United .  ` When I began there in 2008 the club , quite frankly , was in a really poor state . It was n't easy , but with hard work they turned things round . By the time I stepped down in 2013 , Newcastle United was in a financially secure position , standing on its own two feet , and it continues to remain so .  McCoist and McDowall on the bench for the Scottish giants earlier this season  ` As I begin my new period of office at Rangers Football Club , I am fully aware that this club has a great tradition and proud history . The responsibility resting on my shoulders is something I do not take lightly .  ` I know that the relationship between the board and some shareholders and fans has become strained . I understand those frustrations but that was then and this is now .  ` The task ahead will not be easy . There will be times ahead when we will have to take and make difficult decisions . Not everything I do will be popular . But I can guarantee that everything I do will be in the best interests of Rangers Football Club to secure its long-term financial stability . I only ask for your patience and an open mind .  ` This is a journey we will have to take together . The recipe for the future is simple . We need financial stability off the pitch and great football on the pitch .  ` Our goal is to get Rangers back to the Premier League and to be in Europe . That is all I can offer you now . Hopefully next year we 'll have a much better speech .

167	Leader : Abubakar Shekau , head of Boko Haram , speaks in a video released by the Islamist group  More than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram have been married off to militants , according to a man claiming to be the leader of the Islamic extremists .  The man , who identifies himself as Abubakar Shekau , said the 219 girls , who were taken from the remote northeastern town of Chibok in April , are now ` in their marital homes ' .  He added that they have all converted to Islam and have now memorised two chapters of the Koran .  He said : ` We have married them off . They are in their marital homes . Do n't you know the over 200 Chibok schoolgirls have converted to Islam ? '  The claims , which were published in a video seen today , contradict recent claims by the Nigerian government that the girls would soon be freed .  They call into question whether talks between a Boko Haram faction and the government in neighbouring Chad will secure the girls ' release .  The man claiming to be Shekau , who the Nigerian military says it killed a year ago , also denied there was a ceasefire .  Violence has continued since the government announced the agreement , raising doubts about how much influence Danladi Ahmadu , the man with whom the govenment is negotiating , has over the group .  Shekau also announced that Boko Haram , which means ` Western education is sinful ' , was holding a German hostage after kidnapping him from the northeastern city of Gombe in July .  Armed militants , understood to be linked to Boko Haram , kidnapped the teacher from a technical college .  Boko Haram has killed thousands of people since launching its campaign for an Islamic state five years ago .  The terror group has attacked targets almost every day for weeks . Last week it seized control of Mubi , the home town of Nigeria 's defence chief Alex Badeh . It was Badeh who announced the ceasefire .  Kidnapped : The 219 schoolgirls , pictured here in a video released by Boko Haram shortly after their abduction , have been ` married off ' to jihadists , according to the terror group . They were taken from Chibok in April  Violence : A car bomb thought to be planted by Boko Haram killed at least 10 people at a crowded bus stop in Gombe on Friday morning , pictured above . A ceasefire was declared with the group two weeks ago  They robbed banks , burned down houses and hoisted their black flag over the Emir 's palace , killing dozens of people and forcing thousands to flee , witnesses said .  A car bomb thought to be planted by Boko Haram killed at least 10 people at a crowded bus stop in Gombe on Friday morning , emergency services said .

170	How Per Mertesacker must long for the days when he danced onto stage with the World Cup in front of an adoring crowd of half a million in Berlin .  That was in July , a few weeks before his return to Arsenal and the promise of a season in which he would silence the doubters and prove his worth as a world champion .  There was , to begin with , a World Cup hangover . But six months on and his sobering performance has left Arsenal fans and Arsene Wenger nursing a banging headache .  Per Mertesacker looks dejected after Arsenal were beaten 3-1 at home to Monaco on Wednesday night  The defender admits that Arsenal will need a ` wonderful night ' in Monaco to qualify for the quarter-final  During Wednesday 's disastrous 3-1 defeat at home to Monaco , Mertesacker was at his indecisive and lumbering worst . And this , do n't forget , was Arsenal 's captain .  For Geoffrey Kondogbia 's opener -- deflected in via the German -- he was lethargic in his closing of the France midfielder and his limp body was an all-too-easy detour on its path to goal .  A John Terry , for example , would surely have closed with more aggression and purpose .  Mertesacker continued to dither and unnerve until his fatal involvement in Monaco 's tie-changing second .  For reasons only known to the 30-year-old , he chose to chase possession inside the opposition half , a pursuit which was always destined to fail . And so it did .  Monaco broke , Mertesacker was a spectator and Dimitar Berbatov -- the former Fulham reserve -- climaxed their attack with a cool finish .  Geoffrey Kondogbia lets fly and his shot takes a wicked deflection off Mertesacker 's chest for the opener  Dimitar Berbatov enjoyed his second half strike which put the game beyond Arsenal  Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain struck a sublime effort deep in injury time which appeared to give the Gunners hope  But that was extinguished after Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco punished more defensive laxity to make it 3-1  In the aftermath of the concession the cameras cut to the forlorn centre-back -- for it took a few seconds to locate him on halfway . But his face was pained , remorseful for his part in the goal .  Even for the tie-clinching third he was slow to close the scorer , although he had been left brutally exposed by the shortcomings of his team-mates .  Ironically , Mertesacker 's best performance was saved for the post-match rallying cry he issued ahead of the second leg in Monaco .  ` Let 's try to raise everyone 's level at Monaco . Let 's try to get in our rhythm there . We could have scored more than three goals last night and we can hurt them , ' he said .  ` We have to focus on that . We ca n't look back and think too much about this game . We will analyse what went wrong , but when we travel to Monaco we have to be on the front foot , be brave and get the best out of ourselves . '  Mertesacker celebrates with the World Cup trophy in the German dressing room after their victory  Mertesacker leads the celebrations in front of the German fans after their World Cup triumph in July   Left to right  Ron-Robert Zieler , Boateng , Sami Khedira and Mertesacker celebrate in Berlin after their win  Mertesacker can only hope they do not spend too long poring over the ills of the first leg , for he would take star billing in any DVD nasty .  Leadership -- and , for a second time , let us remind ourselves he is the captain -- comes from the heart of a defence .  But Mertesacker has cut a subdued and sulky figure all season . Sportsmail 's Jamie Carragher tore into him following his abdication of responsibility during the 3-2 defeat at Stoke .  It did n't take forensic inspection to determine just how bad he was that afternoon . Nor does it take analysis from the game 's sharpest minds to pinpoint the weakness in Arsenal 's side right now .  Indeed , from stumbling giraffes to turning cargo ships , Mertesacker was the subject of social-media ridicule in the hours after the loss to Monaco .  How he must long for the days of summer .

171	Stacking supermarket shelves is better than dreaming of stardom via TV 's The X Factor , Iain Duncan Smith insists today as he mounts an extraordinary attack on critics of a flagship work experience scheme for benefit claimants .  The Work and Pensions Secretary reveals that thousands of youngsters on the dole have already secured jobs after taking part in a Government programme which offers two-month placements with leading employers -- with more than half coming off benefits .  Human rights lawyers representing an unemployed graduate who objected to stacking shelves in budget store Poundland have led critics to liken the scheme to ` slave labour ' .  Fantasy world : Iain Duncan Smith rallies against the belief that being a celebrity or appearing on the X Factor is the only route worth pursuing in life . Pictures are Little Mix - the winners of the talent show last year  Success : The Work and Pensions Secretary reveals that thousands of youngsters on the dole have already secured jobs after taking part in a Government programme  Mr Duncan Smith argues that some of the country 's most successful businessmen -- including former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy -- started their careers on the shop floor .  Work , he says , can give people languishing on welfare handouts a sense of purpose and open up opportunities .  Mr Duncan Smith argues that an obsession with celebrity risks breaking the link between ` success and hard work ' -- as well as indirectly fuelling mass immigration .  ` It is because of such attitudes that we have seen British businesses bringing in large numbers of foreign nationals to do jobs for which they can not find people at home , ' he says .  According to the latest figures , 34,200 benefit claimants so far have taken work placements under the Government-led programme . Firms taking part include Tesco , Boots and Holland & Barrett .  Initial analysis of 1,300 cases shows that after 13 weeks , only 49 per cent remained on welfare handouts . Some stop claiming , but thousands are getting jobs .  However , Labour frontbencher John Woodcock is expected to warn today that while the scheme appears ` shambolic ' , his party must acknowledge its own failure on welfare reform and back the ` something for something ' principle .  ` We must not be diverted by the inadequacies of one particular scheme into stepping back from the principle of increasing obligations placed on benefit claimants as we increase support available to them , ' he is expected to say .  by IAIN DUNCAN SMITH , Work and Pensions Secretary  Over the past few days , the battle lines have been clearly drawn on the issue of youth unemployment .  In one corner , we find those prepared to do everything they can to give a chance to young people who are looking for a job and help them gain experience of the workplace .  In the other , armed with an unjustified sense of superiority and sporting an intellectual sneer , we find a commentating elite which seems determined to belittle and downgrade any opportunity for young people that does n't fit their pre-conceived notion of a ` worthwhile job ' .  Talent show Britain : Iain Duncan Smith writes the country is in ` danger of creating a society with a twisted culture that thinks being a celebrity or appearing on The X Factor is the only route worth pursuing in life '  Let me start by saying that I am enormously proud of our Work Experience scheme , as well as of the companies who have chosen to take part .  Under the scheme , young people on benefits are offered placements of up to two months with a variety of employers to give them an opportunity to get an experience of work .  Firms who have signed up include Boots , McDonald 's , Argos , Tesco and Primark . In return for working 30 hours a week , the unemployed continue to receive their normal Jobseeker 's Allowance as well as expenses .  The thinking behind the initiative is the recognition that when considering whether to take a young person on , employers will highly value any relevant work experience .  It is up to young people to decide , voluntarily , whether they wish to take part in the scheme , and they can pull out of their placement during the first week without sanction .  Criticism : Tesco have faced an angry backlash for signing up to the Government scheme - and employing people on benefits for an initial period without pay  This is why the scheme has been so successful . The fact is that 13 weeks after starting their placements , around 50 per cent of those taking part have either taken up permanent posts or have stopped claiming benefits .  Take , for example , 20-year-old Samantha Davies , from Neath , South Wales , who took a Work Experience placement at a local nursery . She impressed them so much that she was offered a job , and now she has signed off Jobseeker 's Allowance . Or Chris Burke , from Lewisham , South-East London , who got a job as an administrative apprentice at a local college .  What 's more , the scheme is so popular among young people that it is oversubscribed . As a result , we are expanding it later this year through the new Youth Contract to guarantee a place for every unemployed young person who wants one .  Given this , you may be surprised to hear some of the criticism that has been directed at the scheme in recent days , including the claim that young people are being forced into ` 21st-century slavery ' , or that we are engaging in so-called ` workfare ' .  Let me be quite clear : this Government does not have a workfare programme . Workfare is an American term used to describe employment programmes which force all jobseekers to work at a certain point of their welfare claim -- a practice which we do not consider to be effective .  Here , in Britain , it is true that we have a programme which can require claimants to undertake a short period of compulsory work if we do not believe they are engaging properly in the pursuit of employment . But the programme is carefully targeted and -- importantly -- it is entirely separate from the voluntary Work Experience scheme which I described above .  The fact is that the Government 's opponents -- who constitute a group of modern-day Luddites -- are throwing around these misleading terms in a deliberately malicious and provocative fashion , and will stop at nothing in their attempts to mislead the public on this issue . What is utterly unacceptable is that many of Britain 's largest and most prestigious employers have found themselves caught up in the middle of this undignified row .  The firms who have offered work experience to young people on this scheme have been absolutely brilliant and , most importantly , they are making a difference in terms of helping the young unemployed get into work .  Shop floor : Sir Terry Leahy , the former Tesco chief-executive , started out by stacking shelves in 1974  For example , out of around 1,400 individuals who have taken part in the Work Experience placement at Tesco , more than 300 have been taken on in permanent roles with the supermarket .  Most admirably , these firms are offering opportunities and helping the economic prospects of our younger generation .  I hope more companies will see the benefits and choose to take part by investing in our young people in the future . However , to help these youngsters , we also have to expose the lies of those who have launched unedifying attacks on our programme .  Sadly , so much of this criticism , I fear , is intellectual snobbery . The implicit message behind these ill-considered attacks is that jobs in retail , such as those with supermarkets or on the High Street , are not real jobs that worthwhile people do .  How insulting and demeaning of the many thousands of people who already work in such jobs up and down the country !  I doubt I 'm the only person who thinks supermarket shelf-stackers add more value to our society than many of those ` job snobs ' who are busy pontificating about the Government 's employment policies . They should learn to value work and not sneer at it .  Furthermore , those critics waging war against work experience also forget that some of this country 's most successful businessmen and women started their careers on the shop floor . Lest we forget , Tesco 's former chief executive officer Sir Terry Leahy started life scrubbing floors at a Tesco store in his school holidays .  As well as betraying their ignorance and snobbery , our opponents have pathetically opted to use human rights laws , making claims about people being subjected by force to ` slave labour ' . These , though , have no basis in reality , since our work programme is purely voluntary . It 's time to put an end to this damaging nonsense . The hard truth is that finding the right job for someone is not easy . There is n't always one simple route .  Meanwhile , we are caught in a battle between those who think young people should work only if they are able to secure their dream job , and those like myself who passionately believe that work in all shapes and forms can be valuable , for it gives people a sense of purpose and opens up further opportunities .  Anyone who is gulled by those who believe in the first path is in danger of creating a society with a twisted culture that thinks being a celebrity or appearing on The X Factor is the only route worth pursuing in life .  The belief that you can just sit at home or wait to become a TV star and that work simply lands in your lap , in turn , feeds the pernicious idea that success is not related to effort and work .  In light of such attitudes from so many indigenous Britons , it 's small wonder that businesses have hired so many foreign nationals in the past decade or so . The fact is that they ca n't find the employees of quality that they need from the available British workforce .  Now is the time to provide opportunities for young people , to help get them back and competing in the workplace , and to give them real opportunities for the future .  Work experience is part of the fight-back of welfare reform -- based on the principle of enlightenment , not entitlement .

172	England will not be playing in the Under 19 European Championships this summer after losing 2-1 to France in their decisive final qualifier .  Having beaten Denmark and Azerbaijan in their opening Elite Round qualifiers , the Young Lions had to beat France in Saint-Lo to advance to July 's finals in Greece  But goals from Sehrou Guirassy and Gnaly Cornet put the hosts in command and a late response from Fulham 's Patrick Roberts was n't enough to rescue Sean O'Driscoll 's team .  Patrick Roberts was on target for England 's Young Lions against France but it was n't enough to qualify  Boosted by the return of Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Harry Winks from suspension , O'Driscoll reverted to the line-up that had beaten Denmark 3-2 late last week .  A swirling wind in Normandy made playing conditions difficult , with any long balls ineffective , and consequently the first period saw very few chances .  France managed to take one of theirs , however , just after the half-hour mark . Neal Maupay fired the ball into a crowded penalty area and Guirassy had the presence of mind to divert it past England goalkeeper Angus Gunn .  Chelsea ' Izzy Brown came close to equalising shortly before half-time but sent Demarai Gray 's cross over the bar inside the six-yard box .  Sean O'Driscoll 's team have missed out on this summer 's European Championship finals in Greece  France 's second goal , five minutes into the second half , left England with a mountain to climb . Maupay again provided the assist , passing to Cornet to drill the ball in off the near post .

173	Nigel Pearson is set to apologise for his foul-mouthed abuse of a Leicester fan -- but also reiterate his belief that the club needs the backing of supporters amid this troubled run .  The Leicester manager reacted furiously when taunted by a home fan towards the end of the loss to Liverpool on Tuesday night and is understood to have sworn .  Leicester have launched an investigation into the incident .

He has a good relationship with the club 's Thai owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and signed a three-year contract last June .  It is recognised , however , that using an expletive to verbally attack a Leicester supporter , within earshot of children , is not acceptable .  Leicester took the lead after Leonardo Ulloa shot rebounded off the post and in off Simon Mignolet 's back  The advantage did n't last , though , as Adam Lallana hit back with this left-footed strike  Pearson is expected to use Friday 's scheduled press conference to apologise for any offence caused by the flashpoint , which came next to the tunnel after he left his customary seat in the stands for the final few minutes .  In the immediate aftermath of the defeat Pearson admitted to a ` spat ' saying : ` I replied to one idiot in the stands and if he does n't like what he sees , then do n't bother coming . '  He then added : ` Maybe they ought to think about staying at home . We 've worked hard and will continue to do so . I do n't like the commitment of my players being questioned . '  Cliff Ginetta , the chairman of Leicester 's supporters club , believes an apology is warranted and would enable Pearson to move past the incident and retain the support of a majority of fans .  He said : ` He should put his hands up , admit he was out of order , apologise to the people and move on , that 's all everyone wants .

174	The Danny Welbeck fan club used to seem a little short of members . There was Sir Alex Ferguson , Roy Hodgson , a handful of Manchester United fans , me ... and that was pretty much it .  But now Louis van Gaal is prepared to let Welbeck leave Old Trafford , that little club has grown somewhat . It now includes Arsene Wenger , Mauricio Pochettino , Roberto Martinez , Alan Pardew , Gus Poyet , Steve Bruce and Cesare Prandelli , the Galatasaray manager .  All of those well-respected bosses now want the 23-year-old forward at their clubs , and I have yet to meet a fan of any of these teams who thinks otherwise . The Welbeck fan club is swelling fast , and with good reason .  VIDEO Scroll down to watch Danny Welbeck take part in a Q&A with Wayne Rooney  Wanted : Danny Welbeck is in demand with Premier League clubs with his future uncertain at Old Trafford  At a stretch : The United forward in action after coming on as a substitute at Sunderland last Sunday  Welbeck is a young English striker of huge potential . He is a supreme athlete -- extremely fast thanks to his long strides , and strong enough to hold off the toughest defenders in world football .  Anyone who saw him shirtless on Copacabana before the World Cup will know that his body is the ideal shape for a modern footballer , a physique as impressive even as Cristiano Ronaldo 's .  He is also blessed with quick feet , technical agility and ability rarely seen in English strikers , and the ambition to attempt the audacious -- witness his sublime chipped finish on the opening day of last season against Swansea .  He is a fine link player , plays with his head up , is always looking to bring others into the game and for quick one-twos on the edge of the box .  Bags packed ? Welbeck wants regular starts and could be ready to quit United to find it  Young Lion : Welbeck played a big part in a bright England performance against Italy at the World Cup  Strikes : Positions from which Welbeck scored his goals in the Premier League last season  He was thrust into the limelight when Ferguson shunted Wayne Rooney aside for the Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid in February last year , and then dropped his big name star for the second leg . United lost the tie after Nani 's red card but Welbeck scored in the Bernabeu and bullied the likes of Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varane .  A star was born or , at least , it should have been . Despite that sparkling introduction to the game 's biggest stage , Welbeck has not established himself at United and is on the verge of leaving the club .  He is loved by some United fans for being a Manchester born-and-bred product of the youth system , a supporter of the club who never fails to give it all to the cause , even if that means a defensive-minded shift on the left wing .  Other United fans simply see him as not progressing as a player and another symbol of the post-Ferguson mess Van Gaal finds himself in .  To many other fans he is a laughing stock , a striker with a woeful goalscoring record who should never be near the England team . The next Emile Heskey , even  although this opinion seems to dissipate when Welbeck is linked with their club  .  Bully : Welbeck rises highest to head a goal for United against Real Madrid in February last year  Blast : Welbeck scored a stunning debut goal for United from long range against Stoke in 2008  Reach for the sky : The young striker celebrates a strike against Wolves in the Carling Cup in 2009  Withdrawn : Welbeck 's average position on the pitch last season was behind the main striker  It ca n't be denied that Welbeck 's goalscoring record is extremely disappointing for an international forward . In 117 appearances in the Premier League over his career to date , he has scored just 26 goals - a strike-rate of 0.2 goals per game with 262 minutes played per goal .  He can look lost when he sees the whites of goalkeepers ' eyes -- just ask Manuel Neuer after last season 's Champions League quarter-final first leg when Welbeck fluffed a glorious one-one-one chance .  He has also been criticised -- most notably by Thierry Henry on the BBC during the World Cup - for taking the easy options , playing safe passes instead of using his pace , power and vision to punch holes in the opposition . All are valid criticisms and Welbeck must improve these areas of the game .  But how is a striker supposed to become more clinical in front of goal when he is shunted on the wing , seeing even fewer sights of goal , and asked to graft in a role almost more defensive than attacking , as David Moyes asked of him last season ?  When Moyes did play him further as a striker , Welbeck 's goals per games ratio dramatically improved , and he scored six goals in six Premier League matches in a run between December 2013 and January 2014 .  The only way Welbeck will truly realise his potential is to start games , up front or as a No 10 , on a regular basis . And he need look no further than Daniel Sturridge for proof .  Sturridge , now 24 , is becoming a superstar at Liverpool following four years in the doldrums at Chelsea . He too was shunted wide to play in a role that blunted his talents , or as a substitute , cast in the shadow of Didier Drogba and Fernando Torres just as Welbeck is with Rooney and Robin van Persie .  Going nowhere : Daniel Sturridge was a lost talent at Chelsea until he moved to Liverpool  Hotshot : Sturridge is now one of the most feared strikers in the Premier League and England 's No 9  At Chelsea , Sturridge scored just 13 times in 63 Premier League appearances - a strike rate of 0.2 goals per game  just like Welbeck now  and averaging a goal every 220 minutes . Last season he netted 21 goals - behind only Suarez in the goalscorers ' charts - and is England 's undisputed No 9 .  Welbeck can similarly flourish if given the opportunity elsewhere and that is why his fan club now includes the likes of Wenger .  Manchester City and their embarrassment of riches apart , Welbeck would improve the strikeforce of every single Premier League club . Buy him while you can .

177	By Associated Press  Crazy in love : Ramsey Fakhouri tried to make the ultimate romantic gesture by buying his girlfriend an engagement ring , but chose to pay for it by robbing his lover 's bank - and now he is starting a six-year jail term  A love-struck robber raided the bank where his girlfriend worked on Valentine 's Day in a bid to pay for her engagement ring - only for her to turn him in to police .  Separated by hundreds of miles between his Detroit-area home and that of his Illinois would-be fiancee , Ramsey Fakhouri figured he would make the long-distance romance work by getting his sweetheart a diamond .  But his choice of committing an armed robbery to make his amorous gesture has instead landed him in jail .  The 22-year-old was sentenced in East St Louis , Illinois to six and a half years for his role in the hold-up last Valentine 's Day of a female worker who was restocking an automated teller machine outside the bank where his girlfriend was working .  Federal prosecutors say Fakhouri , of Troy , shared with 18-year-old accomplice Alexander Gerth the $ 26,000 stolen during the heist .  Fakhouri 's girlfriend watched the robbery unfold in horror , never knowing her beau -- the one who hours later comforted her about what she saw -- had such a hand in it .  Authorities say in court documents that the romance began a couple of years ago when Fakhouri met the girlfriend at a Bible college .  By early this year , Fakhouri was ready to ask her to be his wife , but lacked a way to pay for an engagement ring .  Scene of the stick-up : Fakhouri and an accomplice stole $ 26,000 from a female employee who was restocking the ATM at the Bradford National Bank branch in Highland , Illinois  above , file picture   Before last February 14 , while talking with his girlfriend by telephone , Fakhouri put her on speaker phone so Gerth could hear her unwittingly give details how the ATM is restocked outside her Bradford National Bank branch in Highland , Illinois , east of St. Louis .  Equipped with pellet guns resembling real semi-automatic pistols , authorities say , the Michigan friends drove Fakhouri 's 2008 Ford Mustang through the night to southern Illinois -- getting a $ 120 speeding ticket along the way -- and waited outside the bank for it to open .  At one point , he watched the girlfriend pull onto the bank 's lot to start her shift .  She even called to wish Fakhouri a good morning , unaware he was there .  About 8.30 am , prosecutors say that Gerth -- masked and wielding the pellet gun -- robbed the branch manager after she came out to refill the drive-up ATM .  The girlfriend 's reaction likely shattered any illusion Fakhouri may have had of pursuing a Bonnie-and-Clyde style criminal romance like the infamous lovers  above  who looted banks across America in the 1930s  With Fakhouri driving the getaway car , the two suspects fled and were returning to Michigan when Fakhouri 's girlfriend texted him , voicing fears about the robbery she 'd just seen .  Fakhouri later told investigators Gerth dropped him off in Indianapolis , and he took a Greyhound bus back to comfort his girlfriend .  Later , after the girlfriend received texted surveillance photos of the alleged bank robbers visiting a Walmart near the robbed bank , Fakhouri admitted to her that one of the images was of him and she told police .  Her reaction likely shattered any illusion he may have had of pursuing a Bonnie-and-Clyde style criminal romance like the infamous lovers who looted banks across America in the 1930s .  Gerth , arrested in Michigan three days after the hold-up , pleaded guilty in April and awaits sentencing next month .

Prosecutor Chuck Sherman said 18-year-olds Samantha Grigg and Tyrel Bredernitz worked with 16-year-old Brendan Heim to rob Frolka for drug money , but ended up beating him to death with brass knuckles .  Sherman believes the attack happened in the vehicle and that Frolka 's body was later dumped at the side of the road .  Scroll Down for Video  Dumped : Michigan State University student and rapper Dustyn Frolka , 19 , was found dead on the side of a freeway earlier this month  Suspects : Saline High School students Samantha Grigg , 18  left  , and Brendan Heim , 16  right  are suspected of working with Saline graduate Tyrel Bredernitz , 18  below  , to rob Frolka for drug money  Punched : Investigators believe the three teens beat up Frolka with brass knuckles . Tyrel Bredernitz , 18  In addition to studying marketing at MSU , Frolka was a rapper and father to a 10-month-old daughter .  The three teens were arraigned in court on Monday and charged with felony murder , armed robbery and conspiracy to committ armed robbery . Each individual charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison .  Details on what led the group to Frolka are still hazy .  Phone records show that the Frolka began communicating with the group a week or two before his death .  However , Bath Detective Sgt Gary Smith told WLNS there was n't a ` well known relationship established between them . '  Smith says the driving force of the attack was getting money from Frolka to buy drugs , but authorities would n't reveal how much the group was after or if they were successful .  Frolka was found unresponsive at 10:23 pm near the East Lansing exit of Interstate 69 . He was later pronounced dead at a local hospital .  As of last week , the cause of death was still unknown though abrasions were found on his body consistent with hitting the pavement .  After figuring out who Frolka was with in his final hours , Bath Township police searched an apartment complex in Saline where they found illegal drugs and arrested one of the suspects .  Apprehended : One of the suspects was arrested last Saturday at this Saline apartment complex where illegal drugs were found  The two other suspects were arrested after police seized and searched the vehicle believed to be used in the attack .  The investigation is ongoing and prosecutors say more could be arrested in connection to the murder .  All three suspects have connections to Saline High School . In court on Monday , Grigg said she was a current senior at Saline High while Heim said he was enrolled but had n't attended since finishing his sophomore year .  High-schoolers : Both Grigg and Heim are current students at Saline High School , . Bredernitz said he graduated from the school  According to a 2012 Saline Reporter article , Grigg sang in a local rock band named Undecided .

179	From the terrifying Bird Dung Spider to a delicate Mirror Spider whose abdomen glitters like a disco ball , a photographer has got up close and personal with arachnids living on Singapore 's 64 islands to capture them in all their Technicolor glory .  Nicky Bay used macro photography to make sure every tiny detail of the mini beasts were documented from the astoundingly long horns of the Long Horned Orb Weaver to the menacing jaws of the Ant Mimic Jumping Spider and mesmerising almost human-like eyes of the Net-Casting Ogre Spider that weaves a web between its front legs to throw at unsuspecting prey .  While some people might be afraid by these arachnids , Mr Bay 's photos show the incredible tactics used by spiders to hide and hunt as well as stand out and mimic less-tasty insects .  The Mirror Spider is a member of theTheridiidae family and has shiny , reflective patches on its abdomen that might be composed of guanine crystals , which have been found to be a source of colour on some spiders ' bodies  The Mirror Spider lives in Singapore and the silvery tiles on its abdomen expand to make its body appear completely silver when it is at rest  pictured  and apparently shrink when it is on the move or scared , according to the photographer  Singapore is known for being an urban jungle , but its tropical climate is also home to a host of species of spiders and insects that thrive in the warm and moist environment .  Writing on his blog , Mr Bay said : ` Every year , I make a few trips to the tropical rainforests in the region as they certainly have a different diversity of critters compared to the local ones . '  He started photographing spiders in the summer of 2008 after getting his first high-end camera - a Nikon D80 and a macro lens , the Tamron 90mm .  While he subsequently upgraded to a better lens he mixes up his set-up but has now reverted to using his first lens around 99 per cent of the time .  The Bird Dung Spider looks like a bird dropping by day but by night , it constructs a large silk structure , lined with sticky droplets , to catch prey  It has an armoured abdomen and under UV light glows a brilliant blue  Mr Bay almost always uses a handheld set-up to get close to the spiders , but switches to using a tripod for specific subjects .  He said : ` Shooting handheld allows me to keep more than 3 times as many shots as I would normally have if I shot on a tripod ... as there is no perfect macro setup , I change my flash setup every now and then . '  He has studied the movement and markings of the Mirror Spider , a member of the Theridiidae family , which has shiny , reflective patches on its abdomen , which might be composed of guanine crystals , that have been found to be a source of colour on some spiders ' bodies , Colossal reported .  As its name suggests he Ladybird Mimic deliberately looks like the spotty insect in a bid to make predators believe that it also tastes foul  The Ant Mimic Jumping Spider looks like a red weaver ant and has a slimmer abdomen than most spiders . It also has a fake ` waist ' so that it looks like it has three parts  tagmata  of its body like a real ant and waves its front pair of legs in front of its head to mimic an ant 's antennae  They are commonly known in Singapore as ` sequined ' spiders and Mr Bay has noted that the sliver tiles on the spider 's abdomen appear to shrink when it is scared or angry to show its ` real ' body .  The reflective tiles expand to make its body appear completely silver when it is at rest and apparently shrink when it is on the move , he said .

The spider even waves its front pair of legs in front of its head to mimic an ant 's antennae , which has the added bonus of making it look like it has six legs .  The spiders have evolved patches of colour around one of their pairs of eyes , which makes them look like they have two compound eyes , rather than eight simple eyes like most other spiders .  Their bodies are covered with tiny reflective hairs so they look like the shiny bodies of ants .  The Long Horned Orb Weaver has strikingly long horns , although its is not known why they have evolved this way  The Net-Casting Ogre-Face Spider has front-facing , almost human-esque eyes , but while she might look relatively friendly , the spider spins her sticky web between her front four legs and throws it at prey  Ant-mimicking spiders can behave more like ants than spiders too by moving in a zig-zag pattern and contrary to their name , Ant Mimic Jumping spiders actually avoid jumping so not to blow their cover .  Biologists believe they go to such lengths in a bid to avoid being eaten by predators who hunt by sight , including birds , lizards and larger spiders .

While it might seem at first-glance that the spider only has two eyes , its four smaller ones are positioned very close by .  But while she might look relatively friendly , the spider spins her sticky web between her front four legs .  Once the trap is set , she waits for prey and then hurls the net , and herself at it in a terrifying attack .

180	By Freya Noble  What started out as a man with a passion for photographing the sea , has now become the entire world for an early-rising and seriously skilled photographer from Bondi .  In 1999 Eugene Tan begun to wake that little bit earlier before his commute into the city to his full-time design job , and took the time to capture the sunrise .  Every morning since then Uge , as he 's known to nearly 45,000 Aquabumps subscribers , has photographed the first light of the day over Sydney 's iconic Bondi Beach .  Aquabumps began more than 15 years ago , when Eugene Tan decided to photograph the sunrise over Bondi Beach every morning  Uge specialises in underwater photography , and what begun as a hobby has become his entire business  Another of his trademarks is aerial shots , sometimes taken from a remote operated helicopter  Aquabumps has taken Uge and his family around the world to shoot in Hawaii , Fiji , Indonesia and Italy  Since 1999 Uge has sent a daily email with shots of the sunrise over Bondi Beach to subscribers  ' I believe in the niche . My niche is underwater and aerial shots of Australian beaches , I started doing aerials about five years ago , ' Uge told the Daily Mail Australia .  ` I 'm looking for interesting light , a lot of action , bright colours . Anything distinctive . '  And distinctive is exactly what Uge 's pics are , showing stunning serene waters in some images , while others showcase tumultuous swell and surfers taking on huge barrels and breaks .  Most portray incredible light patterns , some are perfectly formed waves against a bright backdrop , while the underwater shots reveal the full power of the sea from a whole new perspective .  Intricate and interesting light patterns are prevalent in many of the Aquabump photographs  Almost 45,000 people now subscribe to the emails , which arrive in inboxes around the world each weekday  Uge photographs all sorts of swimmers and surfers good and bad and tried to capture what happens down the beach in the early morning  Aerials are a big part of his portfolio , which he started shooting five years ago  Though the images usually feature bright colours , black and white photographs sometimes make an appearance  Before the immediacy of social media and the infinite blogs which flood the online world , Uge was a pioneer of sorts , sending a daily email to friends and family featuring his favourite shot of the morning , giving people that little escape as they sat in their cubicles or at their desks .  ` Basically I just emailed 20 friends , then 50 , then 1000 and it just grew , ' Uge told the Daily Mail Australia . ` In the 90s daily pictures of the beach were n't as prevalent . '  Just one year after Google 's inception , Uge turned his passion for photographing the ocean into Aquabumps , a website which now has fans and clients all around the world and a permanent art gallery in Bondi .  ` We sell online . I ca n't remember anyone selling photography online when we started . '  Crystal clear waters and perfectly formed waves make up much of the Aquabumps archives  The photographs often feature one or more subjects , and are n't exclusively of the sea itself  The crowded shores of Bondi are also a big feature in the Aquabumps images  Serene beach scenes perfectly composed and captured are another identifying factor in Uge 's shots  The gallery is just back from Bondi Beach and Uge insists he wants people to feel comfortable and spend time in the place  He describes his site as somewhat ` under the radar ' despite boasting 104,781 Facebook likes and a further 47,552 followers on Instagram . And that 's in addition to the 44,125 website subscribers .  ` The ultimate compliment for me is for someone to say `` I think that 's one of Aquabumps ' shots '' , in a time when there 's just a sea of photography and we 're bombarded with mediocre pictures . There 's a lot of noise . '  Aquabumps has collaborated and partnered with some of the biggest brands in Australia and the world , including Speedo , Havaianas , Audi , Cannon and Corona just to name a few .  One of his photographs was featured as a print on Havianas thongs last summer , and the shoe was the biggest selling design after plain black . ` Everyone was really surprised by how well that did , ' Uge admitted .  Still waters and spectacular sunrises are often seen in the daily Aquabumps emails  Skilled surfers are a favourite subject for Eugene to shoot , as he loves being out in the waves himself  The Bondi beach lover has only missed two morning shoots , the days his two sons were born  Aquabumps has collaborated with huge surf brands such as Speedo swimwear and Havianas thongs  The shots give a different perspective to the sea through Uge 's lens  Despite this , the photographer maintains ` we 're really fussy about who we do collaborations with , we get a lot of offers from huge brands . ' He also urges that he would n't have enjoyed the same successes if he was n't so devoted to the work .  ` You just have to it with passion , I started something I was so passionate about , and did it for free in my spare time for the first five years . It 's so important when you start with something you love . '  Aquabumps takes the Tan family all around the world every single year , and Uge has surfed swells and photographed waves in Hawaii , Italy , the Mediterranean , Indonesia , and New Zealand .  ` You name it , I 've done it , ' he said . ` Helicopters in the Kimberleys , over the Great Barrier Reef ... We  along with his wife and two young boys  spend a month every year in Hawaii . '  The images show the Australian beach culture quite literally in a unique light  Beaches in New Zealand , the Mediterranean and America also make appearances in the collection  Uge and his wife Debbie recently travelled to London and New York to investigate the overseas market who are also purchasing the prints  Photographs with lots of action and movement in them are preferable for the photographer  The early morning shoots are a ritual for Uge , who says he feels like his routine is interrupted if he does n't get out in the water  Uge said it 's ` very rare ' for him to ever miss a morning in the surf at Bondi , and described his early alarms as a ` ritual . '  ` The days my sons were born I was n't down ... It has to be extreme circumstances . '  On an overseas trip earlier this year Uge and wife Debbie spent time in New York and London , trying to scope out the market , as they ship prints to both cities every week .  ` We were trying to figure out how people find out about us , ' he said , and added that they have plans in the works to get some of the brand there , and looked at the possibility of adding galleries overseas .  There is something distinctive about the style of the Aquabumps photographs  Swimmers of all sorts have made appearances in the stunning series of snapshots of the sea  Simplicity is sometimes king in the serene images  Light and colour plays a big role in the composition of Aquabumps photographs  The thing all the images have in common is Uge 's clear passion for what he does and his love of the ocean  For now though , the home of Aquabumps is at a stunning location just back from Bondi Beach , and Uge said insisted ` it 's not like a regular shop . '  ' I want people to feel comfortable for a while , I want people to come for an hour or two . It 's all free , you subscribe free . '  Aquabumps ' roots are firmly planted in the beachside community , and Uge credits that , in part , to its great success .

181	The EU is set to lift a ban on imports of chicken from the United States which are washed with a suspect acid disinfectant .  American producers routinely wash raw chicken following slaughter with a substance called peroxyacetic acid  PAA  to remove harmful bacteria .  The practice has been banned in Britain and Europe for many years because of a determination to remove harmful bugs at source , rather than using disinfectants to clean up carcasses .  There are also concerns that reliance on these washes could put consumers at risk by playing a part in the creation of superbugs .  However , the European Commission has signalled that it plans to lift the ban following pressure from the American government and US chicken producers .  The EU has lifted a ban on U.S. chickens which are washed in an acid it is feared helps cause superbugs  The proposal has alarmed consumer groups , who say it is at odds with European policy , which has been designed to remove harmful bacteria from the birds on farms , rather than relying on disinfectants .  Just last week , the chef and food campaigner , Jamie Oliver , warned that Britain and Europe risk importing inferior food from the USA under a new free trade deal called TTIP .  Campaigners say the changes being planned to allow chicken washed with PAA are exactly the sort of thing that will become more common under the TTIP regime .  Mute Schimpf , food campaigner for Friends of the Earth Europe , said : ` The EU 's approach to food safety is under attack , even before any trade deal with the US is agreed .  ` Despite repeated denial from the EU and national governments , the pressure is increasing to allow more imports of factory farmed meat rinsed in disinfectants . The EU must take a clear stand and ban all imports of meat produced in this way , and show the public that it is not caving in to US trade interests . '  Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has warned lowering standards risks allowing poor-quality US food into the British market  In the past , EU national governments have blocked moves by the European Commission to approve imports of ` chlorinated chicken ' from the USA -- chicken cleaned with a chlorine and water wash to kill bugs .  This was done as a precaution and because it could mask poor hygiene standards , as well as harm the health of workers in abattoirs and lead to pollution .  Consumer groups argue that these same safeguards should be applied to the use of PAA and imports of chicken cleaned with the disinfectant .  The European consumer organisation BEUC insists that health and safety should be put ahead of a desire to improve trade relations with the US .  It said : ` As the EU and the US are engaged into talks for a free trade agreement , we look to EU authorities not to let their decision driven solely by trade considerations but to put food safety and consumer protection first . '  BEUC said allowing the use of these chemical treatments opens the door to lower hygiene standards on farms and in slaughterhouses . This is because producers may believe they can wash away any contaminants , rather than ensuring they are not there in the first place .  It said : ` We are concerned that PAA washes will not deliver any extra safety net . Rather , we see the risk they might be seen as a convenient substitute for good slaughter hygiene .  ` The availability of such treatment might lead slaughterhouse staff to be less vigilant on preventing carcass contamination to happen in the first place , hence putting consumers ' health at risk . '  The European Food Safety Authority has ruled that PAA is not toxic to humans , although it can trigger asthma and allergies in workers at processing plants where it is used . The death of a poultry inspector made the headlines in the US in 2013 and raised questions about the health risks associated with the use of chemical decontamination treatments of meat such as PAA .  BEUC is also concerned that bugs might mutate and become immune to the chemicals used in the washing process , so getting through to the meat sold in supermarkets and restaurants .  Consumer groups have said shoppers do n't like the idea of their meat having been washed in chemicals  The group said there is also sound research showing shoppers do not like the idea of their chicken being treated with an acid wash .  Research by the consumer group Which ? in 2011 showed that 60 per cent of people were unlikely to buy chicken that had been sprayed or washed with a mild acid .  The British Poultry Council said the UK and European tradition of trying to keep harmful bugs out of the food chain , from farm to fork , was better for the public than relying on chemical disinfectants .  Chief executive , Andrew Large , said : ` Chemical treatments should never be used as a substitute for good hygiene practice .  ` EFSA has confirmed that peroxyacetic acid is safe to use in food production , but British poultry producers are not yet convinced its use is in the best interests of consumers compared to our farm-to-fork system . '    	  Food chiefs are to allow in chickens washed in peroxyacetic acid  PAA     Experts fear the practice could be aiding the spread of superbugs    Consumer groups have also warned that shoppers do n't like the idea    Others say trade links with the USA are being put ahead of safety    European Food Safety Authority has ruled that PAA is not toxic to humans	The EU is set to lift a ban on imports of chicken from the United States which are washed with a suspect acid disinfectant .

Medics had to free the two friends who ` bonded ' during class when they accidentally superglued their hands together in an arm-wrestling contest .  Nathan , 13 , and Kyle , 14 , both of Hartlepool , were in a music lesson at High Tunstall College of Science when another student brought out a tube of pink glue . The substance was squirted onto Kyle 's hand , who then challenged Nathan to an arm wrestle .  But within seconds , the Year Nine pupils found themselves in a sticky situation .  Nathan Wilkins , 13  right  , and Kyle Robinson , 14  left  , had to be separated by medics when they superglued their hands together during an arm-wrestling contest at High Tunstall College of Science in Hartlepool  Nathan and Kyle both of Hartlepool , were in a music lesson when another student brought out a tube of pink glue . The substance was squirted onto Kyle 's hand , who then challenged Nathan to an arm wrestle  At first their teacher did not believe them but soon realised the pair could not be freed .  School staff contacted the boys ' parents at 10am , with Nathan 's mother , Chris Coxon , 46 , arranging for transport to take boys to the One Life Hartlepool out of hours health centre .  Once there , staff and nurses giggled as they tried to un-stick the teenagers .  Staff at the centre tried nail varnish initially , but when it did not work , a medical guide was consulted and they tried hot soapy water .  After steeping their hands in the water for about half-an-hour , Nathan , 13 , and Kyle , 14 , both of Hartlepool , managed to pull their hands apart .

She added : ` The staff had a right laugh at them and they had to read to find out what would take it off .  ` Then they put their hands in scalding hot water with soap for a good 30 minutes before they were eventually freed .

183	Hannah Green 's 30th birthday is a day she will never forget but not for the reasons you might expect .  At 20 weeks pregnant , it was also the day Hannah , now 31 , discovered her unborn daughter Lola had a congenital heart disease and would need open heart surgery as soon as she was born .  With no history of the condition in the family the unexpected news left Hannah and her partner Gerard Bradley , 30 , from Gosport , Hampshire , devastated , and Hannah vowed to do everything she could to ensure her daughter had the best start in life .  Scroll down for video  Hannah Green with daughter Lola , now a happy and healthy eight months old  Hannah said : ` It was my routine 20-week scan and they could n't see the valve coming off the left hand side of the baby 's heart .  ` None of this affected the baby while it was inside me but once the baby was delivered they would n't be able to get enough oxygen . '  Hannah and Gerard 's baby had transposition of the great arteries , a rare heart defect in which the two main arteries leaving the heart are reversed .  Because of the shock diagnosis the couple decided to find out the sex of their unborn baby , which they had planned to keep a surprise .  ' I felt like we needed to know her sex . I needed to feel something positive and connect with her . We did n't need any more surprises , ' first time mum said .  The diagnosis meant that Lola would need open heart surgery to switch the arteries back to their correct position as soon as she was born .  Lola had open heart surgery when she was just ten days old in an eight-hour operation to swap arteries  Newborn Lola with proud parents Hannah and dad Gerard Bradley , a tattoo artist  ` It 's so easy to take it for granted when you have a healthy baby . When you find out there 's a problem with your baby that will require medical intervention you want to do anything you can to make it better . '  So when Hannah attended London ExCel 's Baby Show in February 2014 and came across stem cell banking company Precious Cells , she realised the procedure could prove priceless .  Stem cells are found in the cord blood that remains in the placenta and umbilical cord , which are usually thrown away , after a baby is born .  The stem cells are an exact DNA match to the baby and can help cure many life threatening diseases , such as leukaemia and sickle cell disease .  Although stem cell banking is popular in America there are currently only four NHS hospitals in the UK offering the service . New parents -- including Sky Sports presenter Natalie Pinkham who gave birth to her first child Wilfred in January - are using private stem cell banking companies instead .  Hannah said : ` We were going to look for a crib and a pram and came away with information about stem cell banking . '  Hannah feels comforted by knowing her daughter 's precious stem cells will be there for her until she 's 30  The family poses for a snap , with Lola , who wears a pacemaker to regulate her heart , grinning at the camera  ` There are so many different things that can be done with stem cells . Doctors are creating better and new ways of doing things all the time , and we realised this could help our baby when she 's older . It could also protect any future children we have . '  But with a price tag of more than # 2,000 the procedure was way out of Hannah and tattoo artist Gerard 's price range .  Luckily for Hannah Precious Cells was running a competition offering parents-to-be the chance to win free banking by explaining what the prize would mean to their family on the company 's Facebook page .  So Hannah -- who until then had never won anything in her life - relayed her story and was stunned when she was chosen as the winner .  The couple were given a box containing a special bag in which the cord blood could be stored , and the number of a phlebotomist who would come to the hospital and harvest the blood as soon as Lola was delivered .  ` We had to call the number as soon as I went into labour and keep them updated on progress , ' said Hannah , who was two weeks overdue when she finally went into labour in June last year .  But because Lola 's heart rate kept dropping she was born by emergency caesarean at Princess Anne Hospital in Southampton after a 36-hour labour , weighing a healthy 7lb 2oz .  ` The phlebotomist was in the delivery room with us and she collected the cord blood and placenta straight away . She went into a separate room , took everything she needed and put it into a special bag . Then I was given the box back with the bag inside , and we had to call a courier to come and collect it . '  Hannah Green says of Lola : ` We do n't know what the future holds for us and the stem cells could help her heart condition in the future '  Hannah Green had her daughter 's stem cells harvested through Precious Cells  The courier arrived within hours of Lola 's birth to collect the stem cells , which have now been cryogenically frozen by Precious Cells at their bio bank in London for 30 years .  ` There are all sorts of certificates and insurance policies in case something happens to the storage facility or the company goes out of business , ' says Hannah .  Lola was immediately transferred to Southampton General Hospital where she underwent full open heart surgery in an eight-hour operation to swap the arteries in her heart when she was ten days old .  ` It was a very traumatic , stressful and emotional time , ' Hannah said . ' I would n't wish it on my worst enemy . '  The surgery was a success and 10 days later Lola was fitted with a pacemaker to regulate her heart beat . At four weeks old Hannah and Gerard were finally able to take their daughter home , and although she will require life-long care she is now a happy and healthy eight-month-old baby .  ` Babies who have undergone heart surgery can never have a normal heart again . They have a repaired heart , ' said Hannah .  ` We do n't know what the future holds for us and the stem cells could help her heart condition in the future . '  ` Sometimes I forget we have the stem cells banked , and then I remember and feel relief . It 's an insurance policy for the future , just in case . If we do n't end up using it I will find out whether we can donate it .

He said the problem is ` especially the lack of energy ' .  The Government , he added , ` does n't know how to do its job ' as President Francois Hollande has ` never held a ministerial post ' .  Withering attack : Gerard Depardieu said ` France is sad ' and the French are fed up under President Hollande  The 63-year-old actor 's broadside came during a TV interview in Belgium , where he resides .  Many of France 's wealthiest figures have decamped across the border to avoid the threat of a 75 per cent tax rate .  But Depardieu , who last year accepted Russian citizenship from Vladimir Putin , said it was ` not quite true ' he moved to Belgium for tax reasons .  Referring to the central in-the-sticks region , where President Hollande made his early political career , the film star told Notele : ` He just had the Correze , which is in deficit . '  Exile : The 63-year-old is welcomed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Black Sea resort , Sochi  Depardieu sparked bemused annoyance from the French and anger from politicians when he accepted President Putin 's offer late last year in a move that was widely perceived to be a refusal to pay taxes .  Sporting a two-headed eagle brooch -- a symbol of Russia -- and framed by a large ham drying in the background , a relaxed Depardieu spoke from the Belgian village of Nechin , near the French border , where he has set up home .  ` It was not quite true , ' he said of the claim he left France over a tax row , adding that he already paid '50 percent ' tax in Belgium . He was not in Belgium ` to make money ' , he said .  Not only is Nechin only 125 miles from Paris 's Charles de Gaulle airport , he explained , but having friends in the village and the high quality of the local meat were also factors that tempted him away from France , he said .  Coffers : The actor claims to have paid 145 million euros in taxes in 45 years of working in France  But he nonetheless judged Hollande 's fiscal policy to be ' a bit over the top ' .  French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault and Culture Minister Aurelie Filippetti , both of whom were highly critical of Depardieu 's flight abroad , also received a verbal swipe from the actor .  ` You ca n't criticise someone who pays 87 percent tax , ' said the star of Cyrano de Bergerac and Green Card .  Depardieu has said that he paid 85 percent tax on his revenues in 2012 and that over 45 years of working and running businesses in France he had paid 145 million euros to state coffers .  In the interview he also revealed his plans to buy a restaurant near Nechin and , on the film side of things , said he had projects in both the United States and , of course , Russia .

185	By Ray Massey  Campaigners threatened to take legal action against the Government yesterday after it published a 50,000-page dossier on HS2 -- which the public have barely 60 days to read .  Consultation on the # 50billion rail project runs until January 24 , so readers would have to plough through more than 800 pages a day -- the equivalent of reading War and Peace around 35 times .  The Bill had its first reading in Parliament yesterday . Details revealed include the amount of land required for the project -- about 2,500 hectares of high quality agricultural land and 2,300 hectares of poorer quality land .  Campaigners have been given just 60 days to read a 50,000 consultation report on HS2  This could be reduced after construction to 1,500 hectares and 1,300 hectares respectively . Overall the project will require the demolition of 339 homes and 21 community facilities .  Together with its environmental statement , the Bill weighs around 1.5 tonnes , roughly the same as a small car .  Councils and countryside campaigners accused ministers of forcing the Bill through by giving the public a 56-day formal consultation period to read and comment on it .  When weekends and the Christmas holidays are taken into account it leaves residents and critics only 35 working days to check for ` the devil in the detail ' , they add .  The 51M Alliance said Government had ` lamentably failed ' to make the business case for the project and described it as an ` economically and environmentally disastrous white elephant '  Campaigners say it will be impossible to absorb the full impact on homes and countryside from the ` fatally flawed ' HS2 scheme in such a short time .  Council leaders complained that ministers were treating the public ` with contempt ' .  There are :  The row developed as the legislation -- a so-called ` paving Bill ' giving the Government powers to construct and operate the high-speed railway between London and Birmingham -- was given its first reading .  Lawyers for the Campaign to Protect Rural England said the tight timescale is likely to breach international law . They are preparing to challenge it in the United Nations .  Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin says work will begin within four months . The HS2 environmental statement for the first phase from London to Birmingham runs to 49,814 pages while the Bill itself is 332 pages -- 50,146 pages in total .  The 200-page introduction alone is an inch thick when printed out , making the 50,000 pages around 21ft .  The entire dossier runs to 585 volumes broken down into 26 geographical areas . A spokesman for the Woodland Trust , which has hired a full-time expert to read the report , said : ` To finish it by the end of the consultation period would be like reading War and Peace every other day . We feel the timetable given to read and respond is unfair . '  Controversial : An undated photo issued by HS2 of the potential HS2 train design  Ralph Smyth , barrister and senior transport campaigner for the Campaign to Protect Rural England , said the United Nations convention on such matters requires ` sufficient time ... for the public to prepare and participate effectively during the environmental decision-making ' .  The CPRE will be raising the UK 's ` non-compliance ' with the UN , complaining that the ` reckless timetable ' will make it ` impractical for the public to suggest sensible changes to improve the proposals ' .  But the Department for Transport insisted it was not illegal , and said it was being ` fully open and transparent ' .  While the public could begin reading the document online yesterday , the 56-day formal consultation period runs from November 29 , 2013 to January 24 , 2014 .  A protestor wearing a mask depicting Prime Minister David Cameron demonstrates against the High Speed rail line outside Parliament  The extent to which homes , the environment , beauty spots and local communities will be blighted is buried within the vast 50,000 pages of the new HS2 Bill and its linked reports .  It notes : ` Overall , the project will require the demolition of 339 dwellings and 21 community facilities . '  It says ` community wide adverse effects ' in which ` a substantial number of local people are significantly affected ' by HS2 construction include : Regent 's Park Estate , Camden ; Park Village East , Camden ; Wells House Road , Ealing ; South Heath ; Thorpe Mandeville and Lower Thorpe ; Chipping Warden ; Burton Green ; Gilson ; Water Orton ; and the small rural community which lies between Weeford and Whittington in Staffordshire .  At least two sites of special scientific interest will be ` affected ' and construction of the project will require approximately 2,500 hectares of high-quality agricultural land and 2,300 hectares of poorer quality agricultural land .  It notes : ` Wherever reasonably practicable , the land required temporarily for construction will be re-instated , reducing the amount of agricultural land lost to approximately 1,500 hectares of high-quality and 1,300 hecatres of poorer quality . '  Although HS2 will not require the demolition of any Grade I or Grade II listed building , some will be ` affected , ' the report notes . ' The project will affect Edgcote battlefield and one scheduled monument  Grim 's Ditch  . '  Some 18 Grade II listed buildings will be directly affected . ` Six will be demolished , four will be altered and eight will be removed and relocated ' it says .  ` There will be modification to a boundary wall to the Grade I listed Hartwell House . Two Grade II registered parks and gardens and 81 lengths of historic hedgerow will be directly affected . '  Planting will be used at Hartwell House registered park and gardens near Aylesbury ` to ensure that the rural character of its setting is preserved ' .  And although ministers insist that no ` internationally designated ' sites of special scientific interest will be affected , two UK ` nationally designated ' sites will be .  The report says : ' In the Waddesdon and Quainton area there will be measures to reduce the impact on Bechstein 's bat  a European protected species  . Measures will be put in place to allow bats to fly safely across the railway line between areas of woodland habitat . '  Similarly , it adds : ` In the Ladbroke and Southam area an area of woodland in Windmill Hill Spinney will be lost . Approximately 11ha of woodland and scrub planting and 7.7 hectares of species-rich grassland will be created adjacent to this area to compensate for that loss . This compensatory habitat will be suitable for a range of species including butterflies and bumblebees . '  The extent to which homes , the environment , beauty spots and local communities will be blighted is buried within the vast 50,000 pages of the new HS2 Bill and its linked reports  The report notes : ` HS2 Ltd has engaged with Natural England in order to identify and put in place appropriate measures to mitigate or compensate for the effect of the project on these nationally designated sites .  ` Where adverse impacts can not be avoided , HS2 Ltd has included mitigation and compensation measures to reduce effects on species and habitats . '  But the Woodland trust said : ` Looking at our analysis of the 21 ancient woods under threat , we believe there are at least three Sites of Special Scientific Interest threatened . These would be Long Itchington Wood in Warwickshire , Sheephouse Wood in Buckinghamshire and Ranston Covert/Battlesford Wood which are part of the Colne Valley in Bucks . `  The HS2 environmental report says that of a total ` Phase One ' route distance between London and Birmingham of approximately 143 miles  230km  , about 33 miles  53km  is in tunnel , and about 46 miles  74km  is in cutting .  Some 40 miles  65km  of the route is on embankment and 12 miles  19km  is on bridges and viaducts .  The report notes that the route has been kept ` low in the landscape where reasonably practicable ' .  ` At Greatworth , Chipping Warden and Aston le Walls the route will be in cutting and tunnel to avoid landscape and visual effects on these rural villages .  ` Through the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty  AONB  between Chalfont St. Giles and Wendover , a distance of over 20km  12 miles  , measures have been incorporated into the design of the project to limit landscape and visual effects . '  This includes 7.5 miles of tunnel and 3.5 miles of cuttings . ` This will avoid or greatly limit the visibilityand noise of the railway in the rural landscape . '  Construction will generate about 128 million tonnes of excavated material and almost 5 million tonnes of waste to be disposed of to landfill .  ` HS2 Ltd has selected a route alignment with the aim of avoiding the highest quality agricultural land , insofaras this can be reconciled with the need to satisfy or balance a number of other important environmental and engineering considerations .

The pensioner was thrown ` some distance ' from his bike and suffered serious chest and head injuries in the crash on September 6 .  Appearing at Torquay Magistrates Court , Knowles-Dixon appeared blamed the crash on her unborn child .  She said a series of ` painful ' kicks caused her to flinch behind the wheel and swerve in front of the pensioner .  Knowles-Dixon , of Waterleat , Devon , admitted driving without due care an attention at Torquay Magistrates Court .  Magistrates fined her # 150 put three points on her driving license .  The court heard pregnant Knowles-Dixon was driving down a hill when she felt her baby kicking and swerved into a hedge .  The woman 's Peugeot then ploughed into a hedge and veered into the path of the cyclist .  Her visibility was also poor because there was glare on her windscreen , the court heard .  Mr Walden was thrown from his bike and suffered chest and head injuries in the crash .  He was airlifted to hospital with fractured ribs and breathing difficulties , but survived the incident in a ` windy , narrow country road ' .  In court : The mother-to-be told Torquay Magistrates Court , pictured , the kicks were ` painful ' and had ` never happened before '  Prosecutor Chris Bittlestone said speed was not a factor in the crash because Knowles-Dixon was only doing 20mph .  She said she relied on her car to do festival work and losing it would cause her ` exceptional hardship ' .  She also insisted that she always tried to drive as safely as possible .  She told the court : ' I was heavily pregnant at the time when the baby kicked me in the ribs several times and very hard .  ` This made me flinch and caused me to have a momentary lapse in concentration .  ' I could not have predicted what happened . It 's never happened to me before . It 's really quite painful . '  She told magistrates she had passed her driving test less than two years earlier and needed her car to take her baby to hospital to have an operation .

190	By Steve Nolan and Ashley Collman  PUBLISHED :   19:50 EST , 8 November 2013    | UPDATED :   19:51 EST , 8 November 2013  An outbreak of a measles-like virus affecting Bottlenose dolphins has become the largest in history - resulting in 753 dolphins washing up on beaches along the East Coast since July .  And it 's only getting worse . As Bottlenose herds migrate south for the winter , they may spread morbillivirus to local groups in Florida .  The only other time an outbreak this bad happened was between August 1987 and April 1988 when the virus killed 740 dolphins . The current outbreak has already exceeded that death toll and if it plays out on the same time frame - it is n't even halfway over .  Outbreak : Since July , 753 dolphins have washed up dead on East Coach beaches , most having died form a strain of a measles-like virus  Spreading : Researchers now fear that the outbreak will get worse with herbs moving south for the winter . Above , researchers conduct a necropsy on a dead dolphin in Virginia Beach , Virginia in August  Largest in history : The current outbreak has already eclipsed the last largest outbreak of morbillivirus which killed 740 dolphins between August 1987 and April 1988  While the virus has n't impacted other species of dolphins in the North and Mid-Atlantic , there is evidence that it may be killing some whales after the bodies of three humpback whales and two pygmy whales were recently found decaying on beaches .  Researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  NOAA  have n't been able to confirm yet whether these whales were suffering from the same virus since their bodes were ` very decomposed ' .  Teri Rowles , of the NOAA Fishers Marine Mammal Stranding Response Program , said in a conference call today that the number of dead beached whales is ` slightly ' elevated ' from usual but that it 's too early to know if it 's an outbreak in the whale population .  Bottlenose dolphins continue to wash up on beaches on the East Coast , but more and more are showing up further south as the herds migrate to Florida for the winter .  Researchers are now afraid that the outbreak will worsen and spread to local populations of dolphins in warmer waters . The virus spreads with contact and shared air .  ` We do n't know how this is going to play out , ' Rowles said .  Whales as well : Researchers believe that the virus may be spreading to humpback and pygmy whales , though it is n't impacting other species of dolphins  Too early to tell : NOAA researchers have n't been able to confirm a whale outbreak since the five stranded bodies were so decomposed , making it hard to analyze their tissue  Unfortunately , all researchers can do is watch the outbreak unfold .  ` There is no vaccine that can be deployed for a large Bottlenose dolphin population or any cetacean species . Currently there is nothing that can be done to prevent the infection spreading , or prevent animals that get infected from having severe clinical disease , ' she said .  While the disease ca n't be spread to humans , it does have the potential to impact people .  The virus leaves the dolphins susceptible to secondary diseases or viruses which have the possibility to infect humans if they come into contact with the rotting sea creatures on the beach .  The NOAA recommends that any beached dolphins or whales be reported to local stranding coordinators .  ` What we 're trying to prevent people from doing is push them back out , ' Rowles said .  No help : Researchers say there is nothing they can do to prevent the outbreak from spreading  	  Hundreds of dolphins have washed up on East Coast beaches since July    Researchers say the problem has n't stopped and that Bottlenose dolphins threaten to spread the disease during their yearly migration south    The bodies of five whales have also washed ashore , and may be suffering from the same measles-like virus    Current outbreak of morbillivirus is largest in history , recently eclipsing previous outbreak in the late 80s which killed 740 dolphins	By Steve Nolan and Ashley Collman  PUBLISHED :   19:50 EST , 8 November 2013    | UPDATED :   19:51 EST , 8 November 2013  An outbreak of a measles-like virus affecting Bottlenose dolphins has become the largest in history - resulting in 753 dolphins washing up on beaches along the East Coast since July .

191	From lovely lace at Chanel to dripping diamonds at Schiaparelli , the Paris haute couture shows are the stuff of fashion dreams .  The garments , some of which require 300 hours of work , are crafted with the red carpet in mind and are so bespoke that they do n't even come with a price tag because if you 're lucky enough to snap one up , budget is of no relevance .  The SS15 haute couture catwalks served up the boldest and most forward-thinking designs the city has seen in a good few years ; haute is all about making a statement after all  even if no one buys the clothes  . FEMAIL rounds up the most glamorous moments the week had to offer .  FEMAIL rounds up the most lavish moments of Paris haute couture week , starting with Chanel 's runway , which was transformed into a paper jungle and watched by the likes of Kris Jenner and Anna Wintour  It makes sense to start with Chanel , which has become one of the most talked-about , anticipated and well-attended shows in haute couture history .  Watched from the front row by Kris Jenner , Anna Wintour and Kristin Stewart , Karl Lagerfeld sent his models - including Kendall Jenner - down the beautifully ornate runway in tulle , thousand-colour boucle and crystal flower embellished everything .  Clearly a key theme in the paper jungle show , flowers featured prominently and hair maestro Sam McKnight 's hair decorations , which hung from each girl 's low plait , trended on social media .  Karl Lagerfeld - the King of couture - unveiled crop tops and lavish skirts embellished with thousands of ornate floral sequins and tulle , as modelled by his new muse , Kendall Jenner , right  Giving the Chanel showspace a run for its money was Dior 's haute couture show , which was held across two levels .  Adding to the drama , the upper deck was supported by white scaffolding so that the clatter of the models ' shoes added to the general ambiance of the show .  There were printed catsuits , ballerina dresses and plenty of sequins , as well as knitted minidresses , crop tops and stripes in abundance .  Perhaps the most talked-about item on the catwalk was the latex legging boots in bold , primary colours and ankle boots with Perspex heels .  Over at Zuhair Murad was a whole different story . The Beirut-based Lebanese fashion designer , who is loved by Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Jennifer Lopez , sent models down the runway in beautifully embellished floral tulle gowns .  The ethereal gowns , which were decorated with blush pink rosebuds and smatterings of sparkle , will no doubt be gracing the Oscar red carpet next year .  The ornate gowns were sometimes slashed from the chest to the naval , but the long sleeves and floor-length hemlines kept a certain conservatism about them .

Watched from the front row by Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and her husband , the designers aimed to capture the Goddess of Spring with a majestic collection that they say symbolised nature 's regenerative powers .  For SS15 , the Ralph & Russo muse is an ` exultant deity , whose gifts lend themselves to delight ' , they say .  Acclaimed for its excellence in craftsmanship , the maison de couture aims to inspire with eye-catching embellishment , such as petal appliqué and pearl embroidery ; the devil really is in the detail .  The colour palette - crisp and most sophisticated - was full of pomegranate pinks , soft mints and cornflower blues .  The collection , above all , aims to flatter the female form thanks to sheaths of organza , which promise to hug the figure in all the right places .  The show saw the models metamorphose into fairies and nymphs , gracefully collecting blossoms in their structured collars or scattering buds into the folds of their gowns - and Mrs Fernandez-Versini seemed most impressed .  The designers at Ralph & Russo were inspired by the ` goddess of spring ' with detail such as blue and white petal appliqué and pearl embroidery sewn to Fifties-style dresses and flirty tulle-lined strapless dresses  A model wears the bridal gown closing the Ralph & Russo show in dramatic fashion  Lindsey Wixson walked the Jean Paul Gaultier runway show in a dungaree style gown teamed with some interesting headgear  Jean Paul Gaultier 's show opened with the silhouette of a bride in a cloud of dry ice to the beats of Billy Idol 's White Wedding .  Each model that followed rocked a look as flamboyant as the one before it from a red snakeskin blinged up trench-dress to a modern take on Madonna 's famous conical bra .  Lindsey Wixson walked the runway show in a dungaree style gown teamed with a beekeeper-esque hat and Naomi Campbell drew loud cheers as she closed the show looking as youthful as she did when she stepped out for the designer twenty years ago .  Valentino , a label coveted by the A-list , served up romantic skirts , dresses and coats printed with poetic embellishment .  The brand 's creative directors , Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli , were inspired by ` love in its purest form ' and SS15 was a story of billowing velvet dresses and hand-embroidered sheepskin coats .  The duo 's main source of inspiration came from the work of Marc Chagall , the Russian-French artist who travelled between St Petersburg and Paris before World War One .  The SS15 pieces took cue from Chagall 's romantic and modernist interpretation of different cultures .  There was plenty of white tulle hand-painted in grey and embroidered with pearls and delicate flowers .  One dress , which was splashed with the moon and smatterings of stars , took a staggering 3,000 hours to embroider on hand painted linen .

193	By Daniel Bates  The AOL boss at the center of the ` distressed baby ' row allegedly called another female employee who lost three of her unborn quadruplets an ` HR nightmare ' .  Tim Armstrong was accused of firing Christina Elwell because she was unable to travel due to her troubled pregnancy .  The fact that she lost three of her babies before giving birth to the fourth made little difference to his decision , it was claimed .  The lawsuit was filed in 2005 and was dismissed in 2008 after going through arbitration but sheds new light on Armstrong 's recent comments .  Past problems : Tim Armstrong was accused of forcing a sales executive out when she was suffering a terrible pregnancy with quadruplets when he worked for Google  Spotlight : Armstrong 's views of women at work were put under scrutiny after he accused two mothers of ` distressed babies ' of being to blame for cutting AOL 401  k  benefits . One was Deanna Fei . They had their daughter , pictured shortly after birth , in October 2012 . She was four months premature  He was criticized after revealing that AOL had cut benefits to employees after having to pay out $ 1 million to care for what he called two ` distressed babies ' .  Armstrong reversed the decision after a firestorm and because Deanna Fei , one of the mothers of the two children , wrote a scathing article in which she accused him of using her story as ` an absurd justification for corporate cost-cutting ' .  But this is not the first time he has been in trouble for his comments about female employees .  Miss Elwell 's lawsuit dates back to the time before Mr Armstrong joined AOL , where he is currently chief executive .  Before that he was Google 's vice president for national sales and was working out of their New York office , as was Miss Elwell .  In her lawsuit she says that by 2003 she had risen to National Sales Director where she was ` highly successful and well regarded ' and was managing the company 's North America sales force .  In February the next year she became pregnant with quadruplets and told Armstrong that this meant she could no longer travel .  Miss Elwell then lost two of her babies , a tragedy she informed Mr Armstrong about .  Nevertheless , the lawsuit claims , Miss Ewell claims that one day when she came in , he showed her a chart which revealed her job had been eliminated .  He allegedly tried to move to her to another role that would have been a ` significant demotion ' - and the reason was because she could not travel by air .  Miss Elwell offered to take lesser role that would let her travel by train and car and Mr Armstrong is said to have accepted then allegedly ` almost immediately ' changed his mind .  At a meeting on June 4 2004 the lawsuit claims that Mr Armstrong ` told her that she was an HR nightmare and that he no longer wanted her in the New York office ' .  Miss Elwell claimed that she was fired the next day over the phone by Mr Armstrong because he said it was the ` right thing to do ' .  The lawsuit states that during this period Miss Elwell was ` in danger of losing another of her unborn children ' - her husband had apparently contacted Google to tell them she was going through a ` health crisis ' .  On June 29 2004 she then lost her third child . The reason for the child 's death is not explained in the lawsuit .  After negotiations Miss Elwell returned to work the following month but Mr Armstrong allegedly said he felt ` uncomfortable ' around her and asked that she work from home .

Miss Elwell gave birth to her remaining child and towards the end of her maternity leave was looking forward to going back to work .  But she was allegedly told she would have to take a ` low level operations position ' which she found ` intolerable ' .  In 2005 Miss Elwell was ` constructively dismissed ' and filed a discrimination lawsuit with the backing of the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission .  Miss Elwell , 45 , is now president of Manhattan-based CAC Media investing and Consulting , a marketing and advertising company .

194	Gable Tostee was covered in scratches on his face and all over his body after having drunk and rough sex with New Zealand woman Warriena Wright on the night she died , court documents say .  Documents tendered to the Brisbane Supreme Court on Monday state Tostee had marks on his face , neck , back , leg and hand when he was examined by forensic medical officer Dr Nelle van Buuren , the Courier Mail reported .  This comes as a judge has said the charge of murder against Gold Coast man Gable Tostee is ` weak ' and ` difficult ' because the 28-year-old was not on the balcony when Warriena Wright plunged to her death from his Surfers Paradise apartment last month .  Scroll down for video  New Zealand citizen Warriena Tagpuno Wright was on a two week holiday in Australia when she plunged 14 storeys to her death , after organising to meet with Gold Coast man Gable Tostee through dating app ` Tinder '  Police documents allege that an audio recording from Tostee 's phone reveal the sounds of a struggle , during which someone is choked and taunted .  Tostee has been charged with Ms Wright 's murder . Police documents have been filed in the Supreme Court ahead of Tostee 's bail application on Monday  Considering Tostee 's bail application in the Brisbane Supreme Court on Monday , Judge Debra Mullins asked Crown Prosecutor Sarah Farnden , ` The prosecution case is that the applicant was n't on the balcony that Ms Wright fell from ? ' .  ` That appears to be the most likely scenario , ' Ms Farnden said .  Police will allege Tostee and Ms Wright had violent sex , and afterward a scuffle took place inside his Gold Coast apartment before the 28-year-old forced Ms Wright onto his balcony and locked her out . Ms Wright then fell to her death .  Tostee allegedly recorded over three hours of audio during the time he spent with Ms Wright , who he met via the dating app Tinder , on August 7 and in the early hours of August 8 .  Court documents also state that neighbours living in the apartments one and two floors below Tostee told police they heard ` thudding and scuffling ' and loud bangs like furniture was being dropped on the floor on the night Ms Wright died .  Gabriele Collyer-Wiedner , who lives on the floor under Tostee , said she woke up at 2am to the loud noises , the Courier Mail reported .  ' A short time after that I heard a female person shout the words `` no , no , no '' , ' she said .  Emergency crews at the scene of Ms Wright 's death at the foot of the highrise Avalon apartments in Surfer 's Paradise in Queensland , where Tostee resided .  Ms Collyer-Wiedner told police she went out onto her balcony where she saw two legs dangling from above .  ` The person did not say anything and neither did I , ' she said . ` In a matter of seconds I saw the person fall from the balcony above mine ... I screamed when the person was falling and I think that the person screamed as well . '  Tostee has been in custody since mid-August when he was arrested and charged with murder .  In court on Monday , Justice Mullins told the accused 's barrister , Anthony Kimmins : ` If your client was not on the balcony , it makes the murder case a lot more difficult  ` But in the context of what happened in the apartment , I would think a manslaughter case is not weak . '  Justice Mullins postponed the bail application , requesting more information after she read sworn statements by police , Tostee and Tostee 's parents about his autism diagnosis .  She said his previous diagnosis of being on the autism spectrum was referenced in the Crown 's material , but was not addressed in defence documents .  Tostee 's high-rise apartment is investigated by detectives . The secret recordings ultimately led the police to arrest Tostee on August 15 .  Police have opposed bail for Tostee , saying he contacted more than 250 girls on Tinder in the months before he allegedly murdered Warriena Wright .  Police say Tostee would immediately go back on Tinder if released and contact young women and , given his ` propensity of violence ' would pose an ` unacceptable risk ' to the community .  A document filed in the bail application in the says an examination of Tostee 's mobile phone ` has identified that he has been in contact with over 250 female persons using the Tinder application since March 2014 ' .  ` Police hold a strong belief that if Tostee is granted bail , he will recommence his using social media , ' a document filed in the court said .  ` Police believe Tostee 's blatant disregard for human life and his propensity of violence displayed in this instance would place the safety of the community at an unacceptable risk . '  Documents filed to the Supreme Court claim the Gold Coast man charged with murdering his New Zealand Tinder date told the young woman ` you 're lucky I have n't thrown you off the balcony ' before she plunged 14 storeys to her death .  Ms Wright was a 26-year-old , visiting Australia for a two week trip to attend the wedding of friends  Tostee maintains his innocence and will fight the charge , after he was arrested on August 15 for Ms Wright 's death on August 8 .  Documents , filed in the Supreme Court on Monday , allege a recording on Mr Tostee 's phone captured three hours and 19 minutes of audio from the night that Warriena Tagpuno Wright died .  The documents claim the recording started just before 1am , and 20 seconds into the recording a male voice says ` F *** me ' , Brisbane Times reported .  Sounds of groaning can be heard , then the male tells the woman she is being too rough during sex , and says ' I do n't like being beaten up ' .  The documents assert that an fight erupted at around 2.13 am , and the male tells the woman ` That is enough . You have worn out your welcome . You have to leave . '  The female , who sounds out of breath , says ` OK ' .  A male voice allegedly says : ' I thought you were kidding and i have taken enough . This is f *** ing b *** s *** , you are lucky I have n't chucked you off my balcony you goddamn psycho little b **** ' .  The male then tells her he is going to walk her out of his apartment without her belongings . She says ' I am so sorry ' to which he replies ' I do n't care ' .  There are sounds of a struggle and the male says ` Let it go ' repeatedly before a metallic object is dropped .  A door can be heard opening and the woman tells the male , ` no , no , no ' .  The male then says : ` You tried to kill me huh ? Well why did you try and hit me with that huh ? Shut your filthy mouth . '  The woman then says ` No , no , no , no , no ' repeatedly and a door is heard slamming shut .  The female then says ` Just let me go home ' before faint screaming is allegedly heard .  A phone call is then reportedly made to a lawyer and to Tostee 's father .  Police claim that CCTV captures Tostee leaving the building .  It is alleged that the Gold Coast man then ordered pizza within an hour of Ms Wright 's death .  Neighbours earlier reported hearing an altercation and the sound of a woman screaming at around 2:30 am .  Ms Wright and Tostee contacted each other through dating app Tinder and met in Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise , before returning to Tostee 's apartment .

Sniper Danny Nightingale , an ` exemplary ' soldier , who served in both Iraq and Afghanistan , was initially sentenced to 18 months for illegally possessing the weapon and ammunition .  But yesterday the Court of Appeal heard how he had been ` improperly pressured ' into pleading guilty .  A military judge had told him he would face five years in a civilian jail if he fought the case and lost , the appeal court heard , despite evidence that he was suffering from memory loss and had forgotten about the gun .  Scroll down for video  Taking on the justice system : SAS sniper Danny Nightingale outside the High Court in London with his wife Sally where his conviction for illegally possessing a firearm was overturned  Sgt Nightingale , 38 , was later freed after judges cut his sentence following a vigorous campaign led by his wife Sally , father Humphrey and support from newspapers , including the Daily Mail .  Yesterday he clenched his wife 's hand as he listened to Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge quash the conviction , saying the original judge had ` improperly narrowed ' his freedom of choice when he decided to plead guilty .  Sgt Nightingale now faces a retrial . But even if convicted , the worst he could receive is a suspended sentence , meaning he will not return to jail .  Outside court the father of two said : ` There will be a few bubbles tonight . I think we deserve them .

Sniper : Sgt Nightingale in his SAS camouflage  ` We will attack the retrial with the same vigour and tenacity that we have done with this . '  He said he hoped to return to service ahead of his retrial but said that decision would be for the Ministry of Defence .  The court heard that the 9mm Glock pistol was a gift from Iraqi soldiers he had helped to train .  The soldier , from Crewe in Cheshire , intended to pass the gun to his regiment to be decommissioned and displayed as a war trophy .  But he forgot about it after suffering ` significant ' brain damage that affected his memory when he collapsed on a charity trek in the Brazilian jungle .  The Glock and 338 rounds of ammunition were found when police raided his rented home in Hereford last year , following a dispute between his housemate and the housemate 's estranged wife .  Sgt Nightingale pleaded guilty to two charges at a court martial last November and was sent to the Military Corrective Training Centre in Colchester .  But the Appeal Court heard yesterday that the judge advocate who presided over his court martial had given a ` direct wink ' to Sgt Nightingale that if he was convicted after pleading not guilty , he would face five years in jail .  Together again : Sgt Nightingale relaxes at home with daughters Mara , five , Alys , two , and wife Sally after he was allowed home in time for Christmas  ` That is a message that should never have come from the bench , ' William Clegg QC , for Sgt Nightingale , told the hearing .  Mr Clegg said Sgt Nightingale felt he faced the prospect of a ` very lengthy separation ' from his wife and daughters Alys , two , and Mara , five , if he lost the case .  Lord Judge , sitting with Mr Justice MacKay and Mr Justice Sweeney , ruled : ` It seems abundantly clear that the judge advocate was in fact giving an uninvited sentence indication .  ` The defendant 's freedom of choice was improperly narrowed . '  After the ruling , Mrs Nightingale said she had ` mixed emotions ' .  ` I 'm relieved the convictions have been quashed .

Britain 's drivers spend an average of 32 hours annually in gridlock . But while London has the longest delays , it is beaten by Manchester for having the worst jams .  This is because researchers measured not just the length of delay but also the ` intensity ' of gridlock and the degree to which it is greater than normal free-flow traffic conditions .  Gridlock : Britain 's drivers spend an average of 32 hours annually in traffic jams , data from traffic information company INRIX showed  Manchester drivers suffer congestion 24.8 per cent worse than normal and waste 45 hours a year . The worst period is 9am to 10am on a Tuesday .  London drivers suffer jams that are 23.8 per cent worse than normal , but endure 66 hours a year of delay .  Liverpool is third with jams 21.3 per cent worse and delays of 39 hours , followed by Belfast at 20.6 per cent worse and 34 hours of gridlock .

200	By Toni Jones  The clocks have gone back , the weather has turned ... and now we can bring you an exclusive look at the feel-good fest that is the Marks & Spencer Xmas advert so the Christmas excitement can officially start .  Ahead of the seasonal TV campaign which will hit our screens on November 6th the brand has released a sneak preview of this year 's offering .  Starring a stellar cast of British talent including Rosie Huntington-Whitely , David Gandy and Helena Bonham Carter , the 2013 ad takes viewers on a spectacular seasonal journey inspired by some of our most loved fairy tales .  Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is one of the stars of this year 's M&S Christmas advert  For the first time the brand is using social media channels to debut its ' multimillion pound advert , releasing a teaser on Instagram from Wednesday 30th October , before the full two minute version is available on YouTube as well as the M&S website on Monday 4th November .  Set to an enchanting orchestral soundtrack , the ad is shot in a filmic style as it takes the viewers into a world of ` magic and sparkle ' from Alice in Wonderland to the Wizard of Oz .  The retailer has released a sneak preview of the multimillion pound advert ahead of the full TV airing on Wednesday 6th November  Set to an enchanting orchestral soundtrack , the ad is shot in a filmic style as it takes the viewers into a world of ` magic and sparkle ' from Alice in Wonderland to the Wizard of Oz via Little Red Riding Hood  Rosie Huntington-Whitely is - of course - the leading lady , first seen pursuing a pretty little dog across a city street before tumbling from the real world into a snow dusted enchanted forest , seated at a fantastical feast .  The ad then follows the lingerie designer and model through a red riding house scene , an Arabian Nights flight and finally a walk along the yellow brick road , with a little help from the ever handsome David and a bewitching Helena Bonham Carter , whose appearance is seen as a huge coup for the retailer .  Glamour : Welcome to the Mad Hatter 's tea party , hosted by model David Gandy in Autograph menswear  Helena Bonham Carter 's Wizard of Oz is in a black Per Una coat with faux fur collar  The Daily Mail 's Liz Jones - often the High Street 's harshest critic - gave the ad a glowing review when given a peek on Sunday .  She said : ` From my sneak preview , the ad is a triumph . But will other viewers agree ?  ` For M&S 's vocal shareholders , this can not just be a vanity project , an escape for a few moments into fantasy . It has to make those cash registers burst into song .  ` This time , I think M&S has done its homework , and pulled off quite a coup : while Bonham Carter is known for her rather eccentric style of bird 's - nest hair and socks worn with flip-flops , of late she has become something of a fashion icon .  ` Here , Helena makes a hilarious appearance in a fairytale that , although only two minutes long , cost many millions to produce .  ` Teamed cleverly with Rosie , she 's a classy , unexpected ingredient in a perfect mix that will appeal to Everywoman , being neither too frumpy , nor too unattainable .  ` The product placement -- dresses , dresses and more dresses -- is perfect , and there is nothing cheesy about the production , apart from the Cheddar truckles at the tea party . It 's fun , and , given the chemistry between Rosie and Gandy , super sexy .  ` Rosie is a reliable cash cow  excuse the term  for Marks , with her own-label lingerie selling more than any other brand in the store 's history . And the chiselled features of David Gandy will keep mums , who will be the ones lugging those Magic and Sparkle carrier bags home , very happy indeed .

203	The brothers ' father , who was caught with 200 phones , was earlier cleared after prosecutors could find no evidence they were stolen  A family of Romanian pickpockets who stole from commuters to build palaces in their homeland were jailed yesterday by a judge who expressed his shock at the clan 's ` deep-rooted criminality ' .  The Rostas family preyed on train passengers as they slept on late night trains going out of London , stealing hundreds of mobile phones and cash .  The gipsy gang even used their children as ` trainee pickpockets ' , teaching them that theft is ` not a serious crime ' .  Criminals : The thefts were carried out by the  clockwise from above left  Romulus , 18 , Marin , 25 , Cornell , 22 and Robert , 23 , along with 17-year-old Govinder  not pictured  who was named for the first time today  The family , who were living on benefits in Britain , pocketed hundreds of thousands of pounds by stealing from at least 185 victims over two years , although police fear the true number may be at least 1,000 .  The stolen phones were sold in Romania for huge profits .  Earlier this year the Daily Mail revealed how the gang enjoyed a life of luxury in Romania where they built five mansions with the proceeds while they swaggered around in designer clothing , gold jewellery and drove a fleet of luxury cars .  Govinder Rostas , pictured here in 2009 , was given a 12-month detention and training order  Yesterday five members of the family were jailed for conspiracy to steal , but after an unusual plea bargain in the middle of their trial at Blackfriars Crown Court , some could walk free within weeks .  Brothers Romulous Rostas , 18 , Marin , 25 , their cousin by marriage Cornell Rostas , 22 , and another cousin Govinder , 17 , changed their pleas to guilty midway through the trial following a rare so-called ` Goodyear ' hearing in which defence barristers receive guidance from the judge about the sentence a defendant would expect if he admitted his guilt .  Another member of the family , Robert Rostas , 23 , had earlier admitted the charges .  Yesterday Cornell Rostas was jailed for three years and three months , Marin for three years , Robert for 30 months , Romulous for 18 months and Govinder was given a 12-month detention and training order .  Romulous will be free within five months , while Robert will serve less than a year .  Judge Peter Clarke , QC , described their racket as a ` highly organised and regimented criminal enterprise ' , saying : ` It 's depressing to see a family represented by so many members showing such deep-rooted criminality . '  The court heard that Romulous , Marin , Cornell and Govinder all have previous convictions for theft .  They preyed on tourists in London 's West End , distracting victims by offering them flowers or the Big Issue , while they swiped their phones .  After the hearing , Luminita Rostas , the mother of Marin , Robert and Romulous , screamed abuse at detectives , hammering her fists on a police officer 's chest .  Marin 's wife , Andrea Ferencz , was arrested outside court for spitting at a photographer .  Bad taste : The Rostas family built five gaudy mansions in their homeland financed by their racket here  The gang targeted late-night trains running from Charing Cross to Gravesend in Kent , where the family live , between June 2009 and August 2011 .  They were captured on CCTV boarding the back of trains just before midnight , knowing that many of the commuters would be drunk , dozing or distracted listening to music after a night out .  They were brought to justice after British Transport Police launched an inquiry into a spike in thefts reported on the line .  Police found 250 phones and 500 phone parts at the family 's homes .  Mail , March 31 , 2012  David Hewitt , prosecuting , said : ` It was a family affair .  ` They targeted vulnerable people who were tired for various reasons , travelling home late at night . The team 's motivation was to steal primarily mobile phones from these people .  ` Other members of the family have been arrested for money laundering matters .  ` A not insignificant amount of money has been relocated from this country to Romania . '  Detective Constable Tim Weekes from British Transport Police said : ` These men are career criminals who have all previously been arrested , charged or convicted for theft-related matters .  Mail , September 28 , 2010  ` The items we found during house searches , along with CCTV and mobile phone analysis , indicated that these men were agents involved in a highly-organised conspiracy to steal , aimed at generating as much money as possible to pass back to other family members in Romania to buy land and property .  ` We know there were more than 180 crimes -- more than # 60,000 worth of stolen property -- linked to this group , but these are minimum estimates and the true figure could have been much higher because many thefts may have been reported as lost property or not reported at all . '  Detectives are now investigating how huge wads of cash were transferred from Britain to Romania .  Police hope to claw back the proceeds of their crimes and last month they arrested other members of the family on suspicion of money laundering following the Mail investigation .  Mirela Rostas , Andrea Ferencz , Luminata Rostas and Damian Rostas were held on suspicion of making transfers of thousands of pounds to Romania to fund the family 's luxury lifestyle . They are currently on bail .  In Britain the gipsy gang lived on benefits , claiming to be homeless and destitute .  Six adults and six children lived in squalor in a rundown and cramped three-bedroom terraced house in Northfleet , Kent .  But earlier this year a Daily Mail investigation revealed how the Rostas family stole from hundreds of British commuters to fund a lavish lifestyle in Romania , where they built five palaces with the proceeds of their massive pickpocketing racket .  The gang boasted of their riches in their homeland where they decorated their gaudy blue-roofed mansions with the Mercedes car emblem to denote their wealth .  In the small town of Huedin , near Cluj in Transylvania , relatives of the clan were seen swaggering around dressed in shiny designer tracksuits and decked out in gold jewellery .  Parked outside their 16-bedroom villas were Mercedes , Audis and BMWs with English and Irish number plates .  The wealthy family also own two farms and recently bought another plot of land for 30,000 euros in nearby Calatele .  Lavish display : The Mercedes symbols on the roof of one of their houses in Huedin , Transylvania , symbolise wealth  Dodgy : The family deliberately left windows unfinished on this five-storey building to avoid property taxes  Ostentatious : The distinctive luxury homes built by the the family - who admit to robbing sleeping commuters - tower over the town in north-west Romania  One relative said : ` Yes , we are very , very rich family . We work in England , Spain and France . We make a lot of money . '  Police believe the family may be part of a wider organised criminal network spread across Europe , operating in Britain , Ireland , Spain and France , stealing valuable iPhone and BlackBerry handsets .  Yesterday Blackfriars Crown Court was told that 17-year-old Govinder Rostas had been ` groomed ' by his family to become a ` trainee pickpocket ' .  Asking for him to be spared jail , his lawyer Rebecca Helliwell said : ` This is how he has been brought into the world . This is his upbringing , his way of life .

204	This camel could probably ask for some advice from hot-topic singer Miley Cyrus .  After all , popularity often comes with controversy .  A commercial starring a talking camel has received over 15 million hits on YouTube but has been labeled as ` disruptive ' by teachers at a Connecticut school .  Scroll down for video  The popularity of Caleb , a ` talking ' camel that stars in a TV ad for the Geico insurance company has created controversy in a Connecticut middle school  The Geico ` Hump Day ' ad has many people laughing across America but teachers at Vernon Center Middle School in Vernon , Connecticut , would prefer to put the chatty camel in detention .  The problem ?  Superintendent of Schools Dr. Mary P. Conway told WFSB that some sixth-grade boys at the school were impersonating the camel so much that teachers claimed it was disruptive .  ` Everybody 's walking around in the hallways and saying its hump day in that weird voice , ' student Brooke Lewis said .  The issue got a bigger rise as some students began imitating the camel during the entire week and not just on Hump Day .  ` Sometimes it 's the counting down to when it is , ' Lewis said .  The television spot features a camel walking around an office annoyingly asking busy workers : ` Guess what day it is ? Guess what day it is ? Huh ? Anybody ? '  The ad - one of the most popular over summer - makes a play on the term ` Hump Day ' which refers to Wednesday being the ` hump ' in the middle of the working week .  The hook is that camels have humps and is a snappier line than , say , ` Dromedary Day ' - especially for a camel that ` talks ' .  The Geico gecko is a popular star of the insurance company 's ads that now include a talking pig and controversial camel  The commercial was made for insurance provider Geico which has a track record for making quirky animals famous .  The company , which spends about $ 1 billion a year on advertising , became well-known for using an urbane gecko with an English Cockney accent for some of its promotional material and has also used a pig and a caveman .  CBS News reported the concept was created by New York ad agency The Martin Agency .  Sean Riley , a creative director with the agency , said the idea of using a camel in an office was intended to make people pay attention to the ad .  ` We were focused on doing something in the office and we were focused on doing something surprising and I said `` camel '' and it went from there , ' Riley said .  The camel - named Caleb - impressed casting directors with its attitude to acting out in an office .  ` We were impressed by his swagger , ' said the ad 's executive producer Molly Souter . ` He has a natural swagger . '  Yet concern from teachers in Connecticut about the talked-about ad is now getting kickback from students and parents .  ' I do n't really think it is that big of a disruption if people are just doing it in the hallways , ' said student Jacob Ruggerio .  Jacob 's father described the issue as ` silly ' .  ' I think there 's bigger things to take care of in middle schools than that . ' said Mick Ruggerio .  It was predicted the controversy would blow over by Wednesday .  ` It is getting old now , the Hump Day thing , it is getting old , ' said parent Beth Lewis .  Maxwell the talking pig from insurance provider Geico is another animal star of the company 's advertising campaign  	  Ad for insurance company disrupts school , claim teachers    Talking camel is a big summer cultural hit across America    ` Caleb ' the camel follows a talking gecko and chatty pig to national stardom	This camel could probably ask for some advice from hot-topic singer Miley Cyrus .

206	It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words .  And an exhibition designed to show the beauty of data demonstrates that some of the most important scientific theories , from evolution to genetics can be summed up in diagrams and charts .  From an early representation of an ordered universe in Robert Fludd 's Renaissance work ` Great Chain of Being ' to a rainbow of circles showing the generic similarities between humans and animals , the ` Beautiful Science ' exhibition at The British Library explores the work of scientists and statisticians through the ages .  As striking as a Vincent Van Gogh painting , this beautiful NASA map visualises the flow of ocean surface currents around the world during the period from 2005 to 2007 . Today 's scientists have access to data collected by satellites and monitoring stations and the supercomputing power to analyse and render it usefully  It is organised into three themes -- public health , weather and evolution .  In the 19th Century scientists were obsessed with finding out about the spread of disease and infection . Florence Nightingale 's seminal diagram demonstrated that far more soldiers perished due to preventable epidemic than died from wounds inflicted on the battlefield during the Crimean War .  The famous nurse was also a keen statistician who understood the power of conveying her ideas about preventing the spread of disease visually and her work resulted in a drop in deaths from preventable diseases in 1858 .  William Farr , a friend of Florence Nightingale , also has an intriguing diagram made up of circles on show at the exhibition , showing the cholera deaths between 1840 and 1850 .  This map by Eberhard Werner Happel in 1675 represents early attempts to produce semi-scientific illustrations of the ebb and flow of the ocean currents as understood at the time from mariner 's and explorers ' observations  He plotted cycles of temperature and deaths from the disease as he  wrongly  believed that cholera was spread by miasma or ` bad air ' but said the circles and use of colours make ` the diagram represent the facts in a striking manner to the eye , ' and later set up the first national system for collecting vital statistics .  A collection of maps and charts prove that people have always been fascinated by the weather . An unusual map by Eberhard Werner Happel in 1675 , represents early attempts to produce semi-scientific illustrations of the ebb and flow of the ocean currents as understood at the time from mariner and explorers ' observations .  A later map from 1863 shows the tropical and polar air currents over the British Isles and was created by the captain of Charles Darwin 's HMS Beagle .  Florence Nightingale 's diagram of the causes of mortality in the Army from 1858 . In this diagram , she demonstrates that far more soldiers perished due to preventable ` zymotic '  epidemic  diseases  shown in blue  than died from wounds inflicted on the battlefield  red  or other causes  black  during the Crimean War  Robert FitzRoy , who is thought of as the grandfather of the modern weather service , was concerned about the weather as he had survived many storms as a mariner and became the first weather forecaster to use wind and temperature data to predict storms .  Modern maps showing weather patterns sit alongside early interpretations in the exhibition and one animation by Nasa visualises the flow of ocean surface currents around the world between 2005 and 2007 -- and bears some resemblance to a Vincent Van Gogh painting .  Today 's scientists have access to mass amounts of data collected by satellites and monitoring stations and the supercomputing power to analyse and render it usefully . Displaying this flow data visually allows scientists and the public to better understand how ocean circulation impacts weather around the globe .  Here are two of the Circos Visualisations of Genomic Data , which use colourful to circles to compare the human genome with that of certain animals , such as monkeys and dogs , pictured left and right  This famous diagram - the only illustration in On the Origin of Species - depicts the diversification of life from one or more common ancestors . The letters across the bottom of the diagram represent potential species , which gradually evolve into new species , some of which survive and others which go extinct  Another modern creation is a chart by showing social media weather sentiment and visualises daily temperature , precipitation , wind , and sunshine levels in a rainbow of colour .  A large section of the exhibition is dedicated to the theory of evolution , which has itself evolved over the years .  A beautiful representation of ` The Great Chain of Being ' created by Renaissance alchemist Robert Fludd in 1617 shows the Aristotelian concept that classifies life on earth into a hierarchical order with respect to the rest of the universe .  In this diagram William Farr plotted cycles of temperature and deaths from Cholera as he  wrongly  believed that the disease was spread by miasma or ` bad air ' but said the circles and use of colours make ` the diagram represent the facts in a striking manner to the eye '  A great ladder links God and other divine beings to astronomical bodies , man , animals , plants and minerals . Each animal is fixed on a rung in order of perfection  upwards towards man  , providing a hierarchical organisation of life that laid the groundwork for the development of taxonomies and ultimately evolutionary trees .  Charles Darwin 's famous diagram -- the only one from his book On the Origin of the Species -- is also no show and depicts the diversification of life from one or more common ancestors .  A map from 1863 shows the tropical and polar air currents over the British Isles and was created by the captain of Charles Darwin 's HMS Beagle . Robert FitzRoy is thought of as the grandfather of the modern weather service and became the first weather forecaster to use wind and temperature data to predict storms  This weather chart visualises daily temperature , precipitation , wind , and sunshine levels over the course of a year using social network data . It also compares 714,843 sentiment-analysed online messages captured about the weather throughout 2011 . The size of the grey bubbles indicates the amount of messages remarking about the weather  Ernst Haeckel , who was inspired by Darwin , used evolutionary ideas to create elaborate tree diagrams organising all life on Earth and the genealogical history of man .  The trunk of the tree in his diagram ` On the Origin of Man ' represents the ancestral history of man , as his ancestors moved through various stages , such as primitive worms , amphibians and apes .  This tree reflects Haeckel 's belief that evolution was a process of perfecting and that man represented the pinnacle of evolution .  Modern charts show scientists ' continuing interest to unravel the mysteries of life and evolution . Brightly coloured Circos diagrams compare the human genome with four other animals , while a molecular ` tree of life ' that is also circular in shape , shows the changing global diversity of birds over space and time .  Robert Fludd 's Great Chain of Being  1617  classifies life on earth into a hierarchical order with respect to the rest of the universe . A great ladder links God and other divine beings to astronomical bodies , man , animals , plants and minerals . Each animal is fixed on a rung in order of perfection  upwards towards man  . From the goddess Sophie , the chain extends down to animals , plants and minerals  The exhibition , which is on display at The Folio Society Gallery at the British Library , until 26 May , shows the challenge of presenting big data in interesting ways is nothing new and shows how scientific and technological breakthroughs have allowed us to visually interpret masses of information .  Dr Johanna Kieniewicz , lead curator of Beautiful Science , said : ` The British Library is home to the nation 's science collection and we 're thrilled to be opening up our fantastic collections in the Library 's first science exhibition .  ` As big data is becoming a topic of such huge interest , we particularly wanted to show the important connections between the past and the present .

207	Farmers and homeowners across country are spraying herbicides on milkweed plants - and in doing so , they 're causing a massacre of the monarch butterfly .  When spraying the plant , they 're destroying the iconic orange-and-black butterflies ' nursery , food source and habitat , leaving millions homeless .  Since 1990 , about 970million of the colorful creature have vanished - a 90 per cent decline in the species .  And in an attempt to counter years of destruction , the Fish and Wildlife Service , the National Wildlife Federation and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation have launched a partnership in hopes of growing milkweed and saving the monarchs .  Scroll down for video  Since 1990 , about 970million monarch butterflies have vanished - a 90 per cent decline in the species . Species are dying out as their habitats are ruined by herbicides and climate change  In an attempt to counter years of destruction , the Fish and Wildlife Service , the National Wildlife Federation and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation have launched a partnership in hopes of growing milkweed  About $ 2million of the $ 3.2 million project will be used to restore more than 200,000 acres of milkweed  pictured  habitat from California to the Corn Belt  About $ 2million of the $ 3.2 million project will be used to restore more than 200,000 acres of habitat from California to the Corn Belt .  The restoration includes more than 750 schoolyard habitats and pollinator gardens , which could increase , or at least keep stagnant , the number of monarchs in the United States .  Each winter , monarch butterflies travel thousands of miles from the United States and Canada to central Mexican forests .  And in the spring , the insect makes the trek back . Because butterflies only live for four to five weeks , the trip requires six generations to complete .  Their food supply of milkweed - which is also their home across the United States - is decreasing . Farmers and homeowners are spraying herbicides , or weed killers , reducing the availability of the plant .  The monarchs spend their winters in Mexican mountain forests where climate is less extreme and they have a better chance of survival . But nearby human communities rely on the same forests for agriculture and tourist activities .  Climate change disrupts the butterfly 's annual migration pattern by affecting conditions in both winter grounds and summer breading grounds .  While colder and wetter winters could be lethal to the insects , hotter and drier summers could shift habitats more north .  Source : World Wildlife Fund  There are about 30million monarch butterflies remaining in the United States , according to the Washington Post .  Remaining money will be used to start a conservation fund that will provide grants to farmers and other landowners to conserve habitat .  The move by the Fish and Wildlife Service comes as it considers whether to classify the monarch butterfly as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act , which would give the butterfly more protection .  ` We can save the monarch butterfly in North America but only if we act quickly and together , ' said Service Director Dan Ashe .  Monarch butterflies travel thousands of miles to Canada from Mexico each spring on a journey that requires six generations of the insect to complete .  On the journey , the insect - which only lives for four to five weeks - lays its eggs exclusively on the milkweed plant .  Conversion of prairies into cropland and the increasing use of pesticide-resistant crops have greatly reduced milkweed , which is also an important food source , particularly in the heartland , according to a petition filed last August by environmental groups .  The conservation projects will be focused on the Interstate 35 corridor from Texas to Minnesota , in areas that provide important spring and summer habitats along the path for about 50 per cent of the migrating monarchs .  Fish and Wildlife Service is encouraging other federal and state agencies to join in on the project and preserve public land as well .  The move by the Fish and Wildlife Service comes as it considers whether to classify the monarch butterfly as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act , which would give the butterfly more protection  Monarch butterflies  pictured here as a caterpillar  travel thousands of miles to Canada from Mexico each spring on a journey that requires six generations of the insect to complete  The group is working with governments in Canada and Mexico to help the iconic butterfly .  Yosemite National Park , too , offers protection for the milkweed plant . Cities across the United States have declared themselves sanctuaries for monarchs .  The groups heading the preservation project said the new announcement was a positive step , but the species needs legal protection .  Monarchs are pollinators and indicators of broader environmental problems .  ` The specter of listing will spur a lot of conservation for the monarch , ' said Tierra Curry , a senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity , one of the groups that asked the Fish and Wildlife Service last August to protect the monarch butterfly and set aside critical habitat .  But Curry said the butterfly needed to be listed for it to recover .  Other species of butterflies have faced extinction in the past , according to Fish and Wildlife Service .

208	By Emma Glanfield  A new television show from the producers of the controversial Benefits Street could be in the making after a camera crew were spotted filming residents and ` exploring the subject of immigration ' .  Film crews approached people in a residential street in Southampton , Hampshire , and told locals they were filming a documentary for a potential new series called ` Immigration Street ' .  The show , filmed by Love Productions - which also made Benefits Street - is set to focus on how people living in different ethnic groups live in close proximity to each other and could air on Channel 4 next year .  Film crews approached people in a residential street in Southampton , Hampshire , and told locals they were filming a pilot documentary for a potential new series which could be called ` Immigration Street '  The show , filmed by Love Productions in Derby Road , Southampton , pictured , is set to focus on how people living in different ethnic groups live in close proximity to each other and could air on Channel 4 next year  Although the programme is only in the development stage at the moment , if it is commissioned for a full series it is set to be filmed over the summer .  Film crews have been spending time in the ` vibrant and diverse ' Derby Road area of Southampton and have interviewed residents and locals for the show .  However , the presence of the cameras has caused alarm to some residents and local figures who fear the road will be portrayed negatively .  Southampton Test MP Alan Whitehead , who represents the area , said : ` Derby Road is a very vibrant , diverse and strong working part of Southampton .  ` It is a community which has been there for a very long time , pretty much everyone there was born in Southampton .  ` It seems quite extraordinary that a company wants to come and brand an area with a particular name they have decided in advance . '  The MP fears the show will result in Derby Road being portrayed in the same negative light as James Turner Street , Birmingham , in controversial show Benefits Street .  The presence of film cameras has caused alarm to some residents and local figures who fear Derby Road in Southampton will be portrayed negatively  A Channel 4 spokesman said : ` Love Productions are researching a potential new series for Channel 4 looking at life in a community where diverse groups of people live alongside one another '  He added : ` I do fear , with their track record , this is not going to be a show which actually points out all of the good things that are going on the area .  ` Yes , it is a culturally diverse area of the city , but the idea that one particular street is `` an immigrant street '' does n't seem accurate .  ` We saw this with Benefits Street . Some people on the show had no idea certain things were going to be said or shown on the show .  ` It produced a picture which they did not recognise and it distorted substantially what those people in Birmingham wanted to say . '  After learning about the possibility of the show coming to Southampton , Mr Whitehead wrote a letter to Derby Road 's residents .  He also said he had heard rumours film crews may have offered enticements for people to appear in the show , something the producers refute .  Mr Whitehead added : ` I have written to everybody who lives in Derby Road and asked them what they think about it all .  ` The way a number of people on the street may have been approached is giving cause for alarm , if it is true .  ` They allegedly approached people and offered to do their washing or take them out for meals , provided they do certain things in certain ways .  Southampton Test MP Alan Whitehead fears the show will result in Derby Road being portrayed in the same negative light as James Turner Street , Birmingham , in controversial show Benefits Street  Deirdre Kelly , known as ` White Dee ' has become one of the most famous characters portrayed in Channel 4 's Benefits Street  Benefits Street focused on the residents of James Turner Street in Winson Green , Birmingham , where it was reported that more than 90 per cent of residents lived on benefits .  Screened over five episodes starting in January , it was controversial with politicians and the police and resulted in hundreds of complaints .  It made household names of residents such as White Dee , the self-styled ` mother ' of the street .  Early episodes featured residents of the street confessing to cameras that they had fraudulently claimed benefits , and at one point cameras even followed a man around central Birmingham on a shop-lifting spree . Police investigations were launched after the footage was aired .  The series generated around 960 complaints to Ofcom and another 800 to Channel 4 . Benefits Street is the channel 's biggest ratings hit since its coverage of the Paralympics in 2012 .  Channel 4 and programme makers Love Productions claim the street is typical of hundreds of UK communities struggling to cope with economic and social decline .  But some critics labelled it ` poverty porn ' and said it is paints a false picture of life in modern Britain .  Others praised it for exposing the truth of benefits fraud but said it failed to condemn crime and also exploits children , exposing them to bullying and victimisations .  Some residents said the show - which shows children swearing and misbehaving - has left youngsters to ashamed and embarrassed to go to school .  ` If that were true , and it has come to me second and third hand , it would suggest the programme would be set up in a way to run to a script .  ` Therefore it wo n't reflect what is happening in the area , and that is very alarming .  ` But this is more serious - this is about a real street , a real community , a real city and things which are really happening .  ` I think there is an absolute responsibility on anybody who is making such a programme to get it right and start off right . '  Producers say they have not yet finalised a name for the new series but admitted ` Immigration Street ' has been discussed and is a possibility .  A Channel 4 spokesman said : ` Love Productions are researching a potential new series for Channel 4 looking at life in a community where diverse groups of people live alongside one another .  ` The title and location are not yet confirmed and discussions are ongoing with local people .  ` Benefits Street sparked an important debate about the welfare system .  ` It was a fair and balanced observational documentary series and was a sympathetic , humane and objective portrayal of how people are coping with continuing austerity and cuts in benefits .  ` We strongly refute any suggestion that any resident of Derby Road has been offered bribes or gifts on condition of filming them .  Khalid Farooq , of the Derby Road-based Pakistan Welfare Association said the TV show was an opportunity to show how multi-cultural the street is  Kieran Smith , creative director at Love Productions , said Derby Road in Southampton was the current focus for the show due to the number of immigrants living there  ` Any filming the team have done would follow strict protocols in accordance with the Ofcom Broadcasting Code . '  Cleaner Delroy Campbell , who flies Jamaican flags from his home in Derby Road , has already been filmed by the crew .  The 56-year-old said : ` I 've done a lot of filming with them already , I do n't have a problem with it .  ` I 'm a hard-working man and I 've lived here for three years , I used to live over the road before that .  ` I do n't know how it will end up , but I do n't think I 've put myself in any danger . '  Hasan Hourani , 21 , a student living in Derby Road said he finds it offensive that families on the street have been asked to appear in the show .  He said : '' ' I find it offensive to the families that live here .  ` Maybe it was a bad area ages ago , but now all I see is good and normal people from different countries around the world . '  However Khalid Farooq , of the Derby Road-based Pakistan Welfare Association said it was an opportunity to show how multi-cultural the street is .  He said : ` I think it 's good . It shows the multi-cultural environment of people living in Derby Road . ` They should show a positive aspect of the community and show how hard working people are here . '  Councillor Satvir Kaur , Southampton City Council cabinet member for communities , said : ` I do have concerns about a potential programme called Immigration Street .  Southampton residents fear ` Immigration Street ' could portray them negatively and attract attention like Benefits Street did to the residents of James Turner Steet in Birmingham , including Dee Roberts , pictured  ` We have a variety of diverse communities in Southampton and community cohesion is something we should pride ourselves on .  ` My concern is it will not show that , and I am genuinely worried about vulnerable people in that area in Derby Road .  ` Some people could be taken advantage of as they will not realise how the final edit will portray them . '  Kieran Smith , creative director at Love Productions , said the idea for ` Immigration Street ' came about during the filming of Benefits Street .  He said : ` It came about as a result of the second episode of Benefits Street where we featured one house which changed hands several times and was mainly occupied my immigrants .  ` It was described as one of the most sensitively-handled pieces on immigration at the time and we felt it was worth doing a series .  ` The idea of immigrants being in Britain and how they get by when they 're here and the effect they have on communities felt like something that was useful for us to do . '  Mr Smith said the crew were currently meeting people and looking into various locations although Derby Road was the current focus .  Film crews spent 12 months filming residents in James Turner Street , Birmingham , pictured , for the controversial series Benefits Street  He said : ` It 's an area which we researched and we knew from the Office of National Statistics has large number of immigrants settling there .  ` It felt like a place that was going to be interesting place and had interesting characters living quite diverse lives .  ` Of course you 're going to get some people that say they do n't want to be involved but there 's lots of people who are happy to be filmed .  ` Like all documentary series you have to be respectful because people are naturally nervous .  ` We are run by very strict guidelines on how we operate . We do n't pay people , we do n't bribe people -- these things simply do n't happen . We 're not in the business of stitching people up .  ` It 's about showing a fair , honest , truthful account of showing what happens in a street over a certain period .

210	By Martin Robinson and Matt Chorley  PUBLISHED :  05:16 EST , 4 February 2013   |  UPDATED :  12:57 EST , 4 February 2013  Quit : Chris Huhne , pictured outside Southwark Crown Court today , as he announced he would resign as an MP having pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice  Chris Huhne has today quit as an MP after he pleaded guilty to making his then wife take his speeding points so he would not be prosecuted .  The former Energy Secretary had until this morning denied a single charge of perverting the course of justice , but now faces a likely jail sentence and the end of his political career .  ` Having taken responsibility for something I did ten years ago , the only proper course of action for me is now to resign my Eastleigh seat in Parliament , which I will do very shortly ' , he said outside Southwark Crown Court .  Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he was ` shocked and saddened ' by Huhne 's conduct but had ` taken the right decision in resigning as an MP ' .  The disgraced politician called his party leader last night to warn him that he would now plead guilty and leave parliament .  He faces between six and 12 months in prison , experts say .  Vicky Pryce , 60 , still denies the offence on the grounds of marital coercion , using archaic legislation to avoid conviction claiming Mr Huhne , 58 , forced her to act on his behalf .  Standing in the dock next to his ex-wife , Liberal Democrat Huhne asked to hear the charge against him again having denied it last week , but this time he replied ` guilty ' .  He ` should be under no illusion ' about the type of sentence he faces , the judge said after his change of plea .  Mr Justice Sweeney said : ` I 'm going to grant you unconditional bail again .  ' I will deal with your sentencing on a date to be notified .  ` It is essential that you attend on that date and as Mr Kelsey-Fry has foreshadowed you should be under no illusion whatsoever as to the sort of sentence that you are likely to receive , understood ? '  Scroll down for video  Moment : A sketch from court today shows Chris Huhne next to his ex-wife Vicky Pryce in the dock at Southwark Crown Court as he told the judge he would now plead guilty as his partner Carina Trimingham  centre right  watched in the background  Trial : Lib Dem MP Chris Huhne and his partner Carina Trimmington arrive at Southwark Court for the first day of his Trial today , where he pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice  Scrum : Chris Huhne and his partner Carina Trimmington arrive at Southwark Crown Court for the first day of his trial , just before he made his shock guilty plea  Mrs Pryce is still going to face trial , which will start at Southwark Crown Court tomorrow .  The couple separated after 26 years of marriage in 2010 after Mr Huhne admitted he was having an affair with his PR adviser Carina Trimingham , 46 , who was in the public gallery .  Months later the extraordinary allegations emerged in two Sunday newspapers provoking a firestorm of controversy .  Huhne 's departure from the Commons is the latest humiliation in a tumultuous fall from grace that began when allegations over the speeding penalty surfaced early in 2011 .  He was only narrowly beaten by Mr Clegg for the party leadership in 2007 , and was still regarded by many as the Deputy Prime Minister 's natural successor .  Huhne received a severance payment of around # 17,000 when he resigned from the Cabinet last February .  However , Downing Street insisted today it was a matter for him whether he returned the money .  Mr Huhne intends to voluntarily remove himself from the Privy Council after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice , the Liberal Democrats said .  In the past disgraced ministers such as Jonathan Aitken and John Profumo have also voluntarily given up their membership .  Denial : Vicky Pryce , the ex-wife of Britain 's former energy secretary Chris Huhne arrives at Southwark Crown Court today and denied the charge claiming her ex-husband forced her to take the points  Exit : Mr Huhne gets into a cab outside the court having admitted his guilt and his intention to resign as an MP with the judge warning he may face jail  Huhne 's exit raises the prospect of a major coalition clash in the by-election for his Eastleigh seat .  Chris Huhne 's guilty plea follows months of legal wrangling in which the MP unsuccessfully tried to have the case thrown out , it can now be revealed .  The MP for Eastleigh , Hampshire , who announced his resignation on the steps outside Southwark Crown Court following his dramatic admission , fought to get the charge dropped for almost 12 months .  His defence barrister John Kelsey-Fry QC had argued that the prosecution case was ` gossamer thin ' .  Mr Kelsey-Fry had tried the stay the proceedings as an abuse of the court process of the court , claiming police investigations had not been ` thorough , rigorous and conscientious ' .  He also appealed to the judge to consider the difficulties Huhne faced due to the passage of time , lack of documents and negative publicity .  He said Huhne could ` not sensibly ' be expected to remember the events of 2003 and that key documents ` demonstrative to the truth in a fundamental respect of this case ' were no longer available .  The barrister described media coverage in the wake of the allegations and in anticipation of a trial as having been ` extreme , prolonged and across all media forms ' .  Mr Justice Sweeney rejected the applications to dismiss the charges saying it was his judgement that ` there is a case to answer ' .  The Lib Dem MP had a majority of 3,800 at the 2010 general election , but it is viewed as a key target seat for the Conservatives if they are to get an overall majority in 2015 .  There is also the prospect of UK Independence Party  Ukip  leader Nigel Farage making another run for Parliament . He previously stood unsuccessfully in the seat .  Party sources said Ukip would be fielding a candidate in Eastleigh and Mr Farage would consider the situation , adding that the constituency was ` very close to his heart ' .  The Labour party played down the prospect of making any progress in the Eastleigh , pointing out it is 258th on its list of target seats .  A source close to Ed Miliband said : ` We recognise this is an uphill struggle but as a one-nation party we fight in every seat and campaign in every part of the country . We intend to campaign hard against both coalition parties . ''  58-year-old Huhne strongly denied the claims when he was charged by prosecutors last February , and repeated the denials in court as recently as last week .  Wearing a dark coat and green tie , the Liberal Democrat MP arrived arm in arm with his partner Carina Trimingham .  Mr Huhne , who gave his constituency address in Eastleigh , Hampshire , to the court , stood down from the Cabinet last year to fight the charge .  The events which led to the case date back to March 12 , 2003 when Mr Huhne 's car was caught by a speed camera on the M11 near Stansted Airport .  He was accused of trying to cheat justice by stating that Mrs Pryce was at the wheel instead of himself when the offence took place.Mrs Pryce , a former Government economics advisor , accepted the fine and three points on her licence .  Mr Huhne is represented by John Kelsey-Fry QC , one of the country 's most sought after barristers whose clients have included Harry Redknapp and Steven Gerrard .  The multi-millionaire politician is the owner of an extensive property portfolio , including homes in London and Oxford .  Mother-of-five Mrs Pryce , of Clapham , south-west London , is represented by Julian Knowles QC , a member of the same chambers as Cherie Blair .  The trial , overseen by Mr Justice Sweeney , was expected to last up to two weeks .  Both defendants are on unconditional bail .  Chris Huhne is one of the most ruthlessly ambitious politicians in Westminster , even in a world where modesty is a taboo .  With multiple careers including journalist , economist , City high flyer , MEP , economist and cabinet minister , he considered himself infinitely better qualified for every job in Westminster .  He used to joke that he would not take a junior job at the Treasury because they have plenty of economists ` and some are even better than me ' .  Defiant until the end , even friends called him ` rhino-hide Huhne ' . But after two failed attempts , he hoped it would be third time lucky in his hopes of winning the Liberal Democrat leadership .  Instead his luck ran out , and his political career lies in tatters .  1954 Born 2 July in west London to businessman father , Peter Ivor , and actress mother Ann .  1972 Gains a first class degree in Philosophy , Politics and Economics at Oxford  1977 Starts career as a journalist , working for The Economist , The Guardian , The Independent and The Independent on Sunday .

211	With the Premier League season entering its final stretch , focus is now turning to the summer transfer window .  Many clubs will be looking to snap up a bargain free transfer and there are plenty to choose from .  Here are best players who are currently set to leave their Premier League clubs on a free in June .  Manchester City 's tenacious , creative and versatile midfielder James Milner could leave as a free agent  Goalkeeper - Gerhard Tremmel  Swansea   At 36 years old , he is no spring chicken , but Tremmel could prove a useful acquisition for a newly-promoted side . Tremmel has played second fiddle to Michel Vorm and then Lukasz Fabianski during his four years at Swansea , but has performed well when called upon in the cup competitions and was in goal when the Swans beat Bradford in the Capital One Cup final two years ago .  Swansea 's Gerhard Tremmel , 36 , is the understudy for Lukasz Fabianski but has done well in the cups  Right-back - Glen Johnson  Liverpool   England 's first-choice right-back at the World Cup is still a regular for Liverpool , but he looks almost certain to end his six-year spell at Anfield this summer . Johnson , who has 54 England caps , is on a bumper deal at the Merseyside club and there seems to be little appetite to keep him on the books .  England 's first-choice right-back at the World Cup looks set to leave Liverpool after six years this summer  Centre-back - Kolo Toure  Liverpool   Another regular at Liverpool who is still to extend his contract . Toure kept Cristiano Ronaldo quiet with an excellent display when Real Madrid came to Anfield in November , but the 34-year-old Ivorian lacks consistency and has made some terrible gaffes in his time at the club .  Inconsistency has been Kolo Toure 's curse - the 34-year-old Ivorian has produced some howlers at Liverpool  Centre-back - Ron Vlaar  Aston Villa   Vlaar performed so well at the World Cup that his omission from the team of the tournament raised a few eyebrows , especially when Thiago Silva was selected ahead of him . Injury has restricted the Dutchman to 16 appearances for Villa this season . At 30 , he has at least a couple of years left in him yet and will surely be courted by other top-flight teams .  Holland 's Ron Vlaar was a surprise omission from the team of the World Cup but could leave Aston Villa  Left-back - Luke Garbutt  Everton   Everton have been doing everything they can to tie this promising young defender down to a new deal , but he is yet to put pen to paper . The 21-year-old has played nine times for Everton this year and faces a big battle to displace Leighton Baines so he may fancy a challenge elsewhere .  Everton want to lock the talented 21-year-old Luke Garbutt down for the long term but he 's yet to commit  Right wing - James Milner  Manchester City   Probably the most high-profile free agent available this summer , Milner has 15 years ' worth of top-flight experience to his name and 53 England caps . Milner is both tenacious and creative , either in the centre of midfield or out wide , and he is still a year off his 30th birthday .  Milner has 15 years in top flight experience , 53 England caps and still is n't 30 , so a great buy for someone  Central midfield - Mikel Arteta  Arsenal   Named Arsenal captain last summer , but Arteta has not played for the Gunners since November due to injury . Hard to see him displacing the in-form Francis Coquelin on his return . May be 33 , but still has a good eye for a pass and is also a free-kick specialist .  Mikel Arteta has n't played for Arsenal since November due to injury and will need to displace Francis Coquelin  Central midfield - Tom Cleverley  Manchester United   Named captain for a tour match against Roma last summer , Cleverley clearly thought he had a future under new United manager Louis van Gaal . ' I think I 'm going to be his type of player , ' he said . But alas , that did not prove to be the case . The 25-year-old was farmed out on loan to Aston Villa , where he has played 30 times . He is not wanted back at United . Villa and Everton are keen to sign the England international .  Unwanted by Manchester United , Aston Villa and Everton want to sign England international Tom Cleverley  Left wing - Jonas Gutierrez  Newcastle   Bravely battled back from testicular cancer to return to the Newcastle squad last month , but is no longer wanted by his club . Will be 32 in the summer , but still a good operator and would prove an inspirational figure to younger players around him .  Testicular cancer survivor Jonas Gutierrez will be an important figure somewhere , even if it is n't Newcastle  Striker - Danny Ings  Burnley   One of a number of young English strikers pushing for national selection after scoring nine goals for Burnley this season . Rumoured to be of interest to Manchester United and their neighbours City , as well as David Moyes ' Real Sociedad .  Manchester United and City are said to be interested in Burnley 's dangerous striker Danny Ings  Striker - James Wilson  Manchester United   Promoted to the first-team squad last summer following a fairytale debut under Ryan Giggs against Hull .

212	India 's tourism minister will provide emergency helpline numbers for foreign tourists and a list of dos and do n'ts in a bid to prevent further attacks on women .  The proposal comes a week after a 22-year-old Japanese tourist was allegedly lured to a Buddhist shrine then locked in a basement at gunpoint and raped repeatedly by two men .  The rape accusation is the latest in a long list of headline-grabbing attacks on women - both Indian and foreign - which has sent tourism numbers plunging .  A plain-clothes policeman  L  escorts two men who were arrested in connection with the alleged abduction and gang-rape of a Japanese tourist , outside a court in Kolkata  Tourism officials estimate that visitors numbers are already down 20 to 30 per cent compared to last year .  Reports suggest the latest victim 's captors were part of a gang of tour guides who first befriend tourists then sexually exploit them across three states : Bengal , Bihar and Uttar Pradesh . Six men have been arrested .  ` The incident is a national shame ' , India 's tourist minister Mahesh Sharma told reporters .  Tourism numbers have dropped following a string of high-profile attacks on women  He added to the CNN-IBN news network : ` We are only getting 6.9 million tourists in a year so that 's a matter of concern for us . We have to take care of the security of travellers ' .  Seven million is a low figure for tourism given the country 's size , cultural and architectural heritage , beautiful scenery and diverse ecosystems .  British nationals make up 800,000 of those visitors .  Despite it 's beautiful scenery and size , India attracts less than seven million tourists a year  Even the Taj Mahal is suffering , witnessing a 6.8 per cent decline last year of foreign visitors from 2013 .  The tourism sector of Agra , the city in which the Taj Mahal resides , has blamed the rising crime rate in the region .  India 's Tourism Minister has introduced new measures to try and keep visitors safe  In comparison Thailand receives 27 million tourists a year , almost four times as much as India .  Officials have said by 2016 they want to increase India 's share of the world 's tourists by one per cent , a small amount for such a large country . Earlier this year a visa-on-arrival system was introduced to make travel there easier .  Mr Sharma also announced plans to reserve train carriages for tourists who book in advance , with better facilities and possibly security cameras .  Some other attempts to make tourists safer have proved unworkable .  In the summer of 2013 , the National Tourism Advisory Council issued badges for taxi drivers and guides to wear that said ' I respect women ' .  While most stays are trouble-free , the latest advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office states : ` Women should use caution when travelling in India . Reported cases of sexual assault against women and young girls are increasing ; recent sexual attacks against female visitors in tourist areas and cities show that foreign women are also at risk .  Even tourist hotspots such as Kerala have been affected by the drop in visitor numbers  ` British women have been the victims of sexual assault in Goa , Delhi , Bangalore and Rajasthan and women travellers often receive unwanted attention in the form of verbal and physical harassment by individuals or groups of men .  ` Serious sexual attacks involving Polish , German and Danish women travellers were reported in 2014 . '  The official advice recommends exercising caution even if in a group and avoiding isolated areas , including beaches , when alone at any time of day .  Even the Taj Mahal has suffered , witnessing a 6.8 per cent decline last year of foreign visitors from 2013  Female travellers should avoid travelling alone on public transport , taxis or auto-rickshaws and when collected at the airport by a hotel driver , visitors should make sure their drivers properly identify themselves before getting in , they say .  India has faced intense scrutiny over its efforts to curb violence against women after the fatal gang rape of a medical student on a bus in New Delhi in December 2012 , which sparked a global outcry .  The most recent attack echoes that of a 25-year-old Japanese woman who was gang-raped in 2010 while she was on her way to the railway station in Gaya .  Official advise from UK foreign office says female lone travellers should take care when getting in rickshaws  Sex attacks against women from Western countries , including the US and Britain , have received major media coverage and tourism bosses are growing wary of their negative impact .  In January 2014 a 51-year-old Danish tourist was robbed and gang-raped at knifepoint in Delhi in a case that grabbed national and international headlines .  In 2013 a Swiss cyclist holidaying in the central state of Madhya Pradesh was robbed and raped by five men , all of whom were later jailed for life .    	  Last week 22-year-old Japanese tourist allegedly escaped kidnapping    She claims to have been raped by two men after being locked in basement    Tourist minister Mahesh Sharma calls event a ` national shame '    Government plans to release helpline numbers and cultural advice    Over last few years India seen a decline in foreign travellers    Earlier this year visa-on-arrival system introduced to encourage travel	India 's tourism minister will provide emergency helpline numbers for foreign tourists and a list of dos and do n'ts in a bid to prevent further attacks on women .

214	President Barack Obama made an unscheduled stop to the Bob Marley museum in Jamaica last night while on a visit to the country for a meeting with Caribbean leaders .  The first president to visit Jamaica in three decades , Obama arrived in Kingston yesterday evening and was met by Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller , U.S. Ambassador to Jamaica Luis Moreno and a dozen other dignitaries .  Obama promptly embraced the local color by making an unscheduled late night visit to the museum dedicated to the island 's most famous son .  Scroll down for video  Barack Obama made an unscheduled stop at the Bob Marley museum while on an official visit to Jamaica  The U.S. President walks around the museum with tour guide Natasha Clark during his unannounced visit  On a tour of the house where the reggae legend lived until his death in 1981 , Obama , looking relaxed in shirtsleeves , was shown a trophy room where Marley 's Grammys and platinum records were on display .  At the same time Marley 's hit song ` One Love ' played over the loudspeaker .  The musician 's family transformed the rambling property into a museum complete with a well-equipped 80-seat theatre , a photographic gallery , and a gift shop selling T-shirts , posters and CDs and other Bob Marley memorabilia .  One of the rooms Obama explored held the late reggae star 's platinum records and a Grammy award .  Thee president looks at selection of Bob Marley 's gold records at the Bob Marley Museum in Kingston  The building was home to Marley until his death in 1981 and was converted into a museum by his family  ` What a wonderful tour , ' the president told museum guide Natasha Clark . ' I still have all the albums . '  Obama is in Jamaica to meet the 15-member Caribbean Community bloc .  The visit is part of an official Caribbean summit seeking to reassert U.S. leadership in the region at a time when oil-producing Venezuela 's economic clout may be receding .  The Caribbean region collectively cheered when Obama was first elected president in 2008 .  Calypso and reggae songs were written in his honor , the French Caribbean island of Martinique named a road after him , and Antigua 's highest mountain officially became ` Mount Obama ' as the small country saluted him as a symbol of black achievement .  Obama thanked the guide for a wonderful tour and told her he still owns all of Bob Marley 's albums  Obama is in Jamaica to meet the 15-member Caribbean Community bloc to discuss energy and security  As the first U.S. president to visit Kingston since Ronald Reagan in 1982 , Obama faces the challenge of convincing Caribbean island leaders that Washington is genuinely re-engaging after a long period of perceived neglect of its smaller , poorer neighbors .  The visit is expected to be dominated by discussions on energy , security and trade with the 15-member Caribbean Community , or Caricom .  Some analysts say a key reason why Washington is suddenly paying attention to the Caribbean Basin is that it wants to wean the islands off dependence on cut-rate Venezuelan oil that Caracas has long used to wield influence in the region .  From Jamaica , Obama will travel to Panama to attend a Western Hemisphere summit , where Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has made clear he will confront Obama over new U.S. sanctions .  Obama will also cross paths at the Summit of the Americas with Cuban President Raul Castro for the first time since the two announced a historic opening between their countries in December .

Scientists have shown that peacocks shake their tails when displaying  stock image  to make a noise that is too low for us to hear . Male birds may make the infrared rumble to scare off an approaching rival or to attract a mate across dusty scrub land , the study claims  Researchers at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg , Canada , have shown that the birds make infrasound noises - below 20 hertz - using their tails and that other peacocks respond to them .  Most humans hear noises between 20 and 20,000 hertz .  Dr James Hare noticed a peacock displaying and shaking its tail at a wall in a zoo , which he noted looked like a satellite dish and made him question whether the bird was listening to itself , BBC Earth reported .  This sparked a study , leading him and graduate student Angela Freeman to record the sound of 46 peacocks shaking their feathers while displaying .  Male and female peacocks became more alert and moved around when the low noises were played back to them by researchers , with males  stock image  shrieking out  Charles Darwin first suggested that a peacock 's train serves to attract females and studies have since shown that females tend to prefer males with the most exaggerated male characteristics .  Amotz Zahavi said the train indicates a male 's fitness . Males with impressive trains have been shown to be healthier , suggesting that the ornament indicates a male 's ability to survive .  His ` handicap principle ' says that since males with particularly brightly coloured or large plumes will attract the attention of predators , they must be extra fit to survive .  Females are thought to choose mates with good genes , so males with more exaggerated sexual characteristics , such as a big train , tend to have better genes in a peahen 's eyes .  Marion Petrie tested whether the displays signal a male 's generic quality by studying a feral population of peafowl in Whipsnade Wildlife Park in England .  She found the number of eyespots in the train predicted a male 's mating success and that she could manipulate a male 's chances of mating success by cutting off some of his eyespot tail feathers .  In the experiment , females lost interest in pruned males and became attracted to untrimmed ones .  Furthermore , chicks fathered by males with impressive trains weighed more than those sired by less ornamented birds .  Humans hear a rustling sound when this happens , but the experts found that the birds hear a loud sound of between 70 and 108 decibels , according to the study published in the journal Animal Behaviour .  Male and female peacocks became more alert and moved around when the low noises were played back to them by researchers , with males shrieking out in response .  Experts are unsure how the birds detect infrasound , but know that some can feel vibration through their legs .  Ms Freeman said that the birds may simply hear the noises through their ears , the inner part of which seems to be the right shape to detect very low noises .  Other animals , such as elephants , have long been known to produce such infrasound , which humans ca n't hear .  And although a type of grouse called the capercaillie produces infrasound , it seemingly does n't use it to communicate , meaning that the bird either ca n't hear it itself or they just does n't care about it .  Ms Freeman believes that male peacocks may use infrasound to maintain their territory and warn off approaching rivals .  But the noises could also be a way of attracting a mate .  She observed that male peacocks were most likely to make the low sounds when they showed off their train feathers , producing two displays which she called the ` shiver train ' and the ` pulse train ' .  The shiver train is produced by vibration of the train feathers from the centre feathers to the outside of the array and is used by males when females are far away .  Ms Freeman believes that male peacocks may use infrasound to maintain their territory and warn off approaching rivals . But the noises could also be a way of attracting a mate . Here , a male displays for a brown , female peahen , hoping she will be impressed by his show of strength  The pulse train is produced by a vibration emanating from the base of all the train feathers and it is used when the female is nearby .  Peacocks ' tails are a sign of strength and good genes , so a strong noise may reinforce a message of virility , Ms Freeman said .  This could be especially useful as the birds live in scrubby woodland , where high noises can only travel over short distances and birds sometimes ca n't see each other .  ` We think that possibly these signals could signal to females and males who are out of sight behind a bush or over the hill , ' she added .

218	Visitors to this year 's Turner Prize exhibition will be met with more than 90 minutes of film to watch - including one of an ` adult nature ' and another featuring Marxist equations .  Four artists - Duncan Campbell , Ciara Phillips , James Richards and Tris Vonna-Michell - have been shortlisted for the annual contemporary art prize .  Curator Lizzie Carey-Thomas said visitors who do not like sitting through the whole of a film work do not need to watch the full one hour 34 minutes of film on display , she said , or they could ` come out very resentful ' .  Cardiff-born artist Richards , 31 , is showing Rosebud  2013  , his film which includes partially censored , erotic images from a book found in a Tokyo library .  As well as scenes of puddles , a bird , and the contours of a fingertip , his black-and-white footage also features ' a head of elderflowers trailed lightly over lips , skin and genitals ' .  A still shot of James Richards ' Rosebud film , which features censored and erotic images from a book found in a Tokyo library  As well as scenes of puddles , a bird , and the contours of a fingertip , the film shows ' a head of elderflowers trailed lightly over lips , skin and genitals '  Three of the creations on this year 's shortlist feature film . Pictured is James Richards ' shortlisted creation , Rosebud  A set of stills from another display by James Richards . Called The Screens  2013  , it shows images from a theatrical make up manual  Pictured is a final piece of James Richard 's work , called Untitled Merchandise  Dealers and Lovers   His footage is described as ` poetic meditations on the pleasure , sensuality and the voyeurism that is in the act of looking . '  His film , which has prompted the gallery to warn visitors about the adult nature of some content , uses a ` range of emotional tone ' to elicit an emotional response from the viewer , according to curator Ms Carey-Thomas .  His second work , The Screens  2013  , features slides from a manual on how to create make-up effects , such as wounds , bruises and blood , for the theatre .  Three of the four artists shortlisted are showing film .  Vonna-Michell 's film Finding Chopin : Dans l'Essex , features salt marshes and the Essex coastline and is inspired by a French sound poet who spent part of his life in Essex , close to where the 31-year-old artist grew up .  His other work , Postcript II  2014  , is a slide installation based on a story about the artist 's mother 's childhood in post-war Germany .  A Tate Britain gallery employee looks at Ciara Phillips ' colourful and immersive shortlisted work called Things Shared  2014   The display is described as an immersive experience which feels like walking into a giant screenprint  Ciara Phillips is the only artist not to use film in this year 's exhibition - her artwork exclusively uses prints . It is open to the public from tomorrow at the Tate Britain  Dublin-born Campbell 's films - one of which lasts almost an hour - tackle African art and colonialism and equations from Karl Marx 's Capital Volume 1 .  Ms Carey-Thomas said that all the shortlisted artists tackled a ` lack of fixed meaning ' in the world around them in their work .  The predominant use of film in the show responded to ` how we navigate the world increasingly through images ' , she added .  ` The internet changed the way that we interact with each other . It 's only natural that the artists respond to that . '  Tris Vonna-Michell 's display  pictured  shows a collection of pictures to accompany a film about his mother  He uses the display to recount his childhood and personal memories of the city of Berlin when he was growing up  Duncan Campbell 's shortlisted works , which use film and video , tackle Marxism , colonialism and African art  Pictured is the film It for Others , by Duncan Campbell .

The Turner Prize , now in its 30th year , has a reputation for controversy .  Previous winners have included Martin Creed 's installation featuring a light going on and off and Grayson Perry 's pots tackling subjects like death and child abuse .  Art movement the Stuckists usually demonstrate against the exhibition but today they handed out leaflets saying that they would not be protesting ` due to the fact that the prize has sunk to a predictable and pathetic level of elitist repetition that is not worth bothering about ' .  The prize , awarded to an artist under 50 born , living or working in Britain , will be presented to a winner on December 1 .  The Turner Prize 2014 exhibition opens tomorrow at Tate Britain and runs to January 4 next year .  In its 30-year history , the Turner Prize has never failed to shock and surprise . While it remains to be seen if this year 's erotic images by James Richards will trigger any controversy , the award has a long and turbulent history with past finalists attracting heavy criticism and sparking impassioned debates about the meaning and definition of what is art .  Tracey Emin 's 1999 display titled My Bed has become one of the more famous pieces associated with the Turner Prize . The artwork , which did not win the prize but was named as one of the shortlisted works , was a recreation of the artist 's messy bed as it lay surrounded by cigarette butts , dirty underwear and condoms .  Tracey Emin 's controversial artwork My Bed - which cemented her place among the top echelon of British artists  Emin said she created the artwork after a traumatic breakdown in a relationship and the candid and crude display divided critics . Despite not winning the prize , it remains perhaps the most seminal piece of artwork displayed in the history of the Turner Prize .  My Bed was recently sold by art dealer Charles Saatchi - who had bought it for # 150,000 in 2000 - in a private auction at Christie 's . The mystery buyer paid # 2.2 million .  Damien Hirst also ranks alongside Emin as one of the most heavily criticised artists involved with the Turner Prize .  His displays featuring animals frozen in formaldehyde have attracted strong debate about the meaning of art and what can be considered an artistic creation , and what is simply a stunt designed to shock audiences .  Damien Hirst 's A Mother and Child Divided  pictured  , showing a cow dissected in half , won the Turner Prize in 1995  At the time , Hirst was was heavily criticised for perceived attempts to simply shock audiences but it has become one of the most famous British artworks of the 90s  He first hit the headlines in 1991 when his display The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living was shortlisted for the Turner Prize . The display featured a tiger shark , caught off the coast of Australia , frozen in formaldehyde with its jaws wide open .  Although it was not named as winner , he soon claimed the prize for his 1995 creation A Mother and Child Divided . In much the same fashion , it showed a dissected cow , with all its insides bared , frozen in the formula .

219	Israeli police say they have shot a man suspected of carrying out a terror attack that left at least five female officers suffering serious injuries this morning .  The suspect is believed to have driven a car in to a crowd of female police officers who were standing outside a border police station between the line separating the east of the city from the west .  Photographs on social media suggest the suspect was left with serious injuries after being shot by officers who moved to incapacitate him when he got out of his vehicle and began attacking onlookers with a meat cleaver . There has not yet been an official confirmation of the man 's condition .  Down : Photographs on social media suggest the suspect  pictured on the ground  was injured after being shot by officers who moved to incapacitate him when he got out of his car began attacking passers-by  Crash : The suspect is believed to have driven a car in to a crowd of female police officers who were standing outside a border police station between the line separating the east of the city from the west  Israeli medics and a policeman evacuate an injured person from the scene of the Jerusalem attack  The attack took place at a border police station on Shimon Ha'Tsadik Street , which marks the line between east and west Jerusalem , according to Micky Rosenfeld , a spokesman for the local force .  The suspect is believed to be a Arab man in his early 30s who hails from east Jerusalem .  Paramedics said they administered first aid to at least five people , all female police officers . Three of the women are in a serious condition , while the other two escaped with only minor injuries .  Witnesses on the ground claimed that after ploughing his car into the officers , the man got out the vehicle and attacked Israeli onlookers with a knife , although that report has not been confirmed .  The same border police station was subject to a hit and run attack in November that killed one police officer and left 13 other people suffering serious injuries .  An Israeli policeman and medics evacuate an injured person at the scene of this morning 's Jerusalem attack  After ploughing in to the female officers the attacker is understood to have crashed into a cyclist  ` The incident was apparently a deliberate attack , ' police spokeswoman Luba Samri said , adding that the driver had been taken to hospital in a serious condition .  The incident took place on the Jewish holiday of Purim , when the streets are busy with pedestrians .  Last October and November , there was a spate of similar attacks , with Palestinian drivers ramming their vehicles into people waiting at the city 's light-rail stops . Those attacks killed three people and wounded around a dozen .  Tensions flared in Jerusalem last year , both before and after the Gaza war , but the city has been relatively calm in recent months .  On Thursday , the Palestine Liberation Organization agreed to suspend security coordination with Israel in the occupied West Bank , which officials are concerned could have a knock-on impact on security throughout the territory .  The Palestinians seek a state in the West Bank and East Jerusalem -- which have been occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war -- and in Gaza , a strip of land on the Mediterranean coast that is separated from the West Bank .

220	British police helped Australian officials foil a suspected Lee Rigby-style terror attack on police during First World War commemorations , it emerged today .  A 14-year-old boy from Blackburn , Lancashire was arrested after he allegedly communicated with Australian men over a plan to use knives and swords to hack officers to death in Melbourne on Anzac Day , which takes place this Saturday .  When the alleged plot was uncovered by Greater Manchester Police , they tipped off Australian authorities who swooped on the terror suspects , arresting five men over the weekend .  Police are now working to shore up security for a string of Anzac Day events taking place in London , including services at the Cenotaph and Westminster Abbey to be attended by the Queen , Prince Philip and Prince William .  Scroll down for video  Arrest : Police have arrested a 14-year-old on suspicion of helping to plot a terror attack in Australia  file photo   Greater Manchester Police said today that the 14-year-old was first arrested on April 2 after police intercepted communications between him and an Australian man , allegedly relating to a planned terrorist attack .  He was then re-arrested on Saturday on suspicion of being concerned in the commission , preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism , and is currently being questioned by police in custody .  Five men from Melbourne were arrested over the planned attack after British authorities passed on their findings to police in Australia , and on Saturday 18-year-old Sevdet Besim was charged with terror offences .  It was claimed today that the Australian men planned to knock over a policeman with a car then stab him to death , in a chilling echo of the murder of British soldier Lee Rigby two years ago .  A security official told ABC that the terrorists then planned steal the dead officer 's gun and go on a shooting rampage which would not end until they were shot dead themselves .  The alleged plot is similar to the killing of Fusilier Rigby , who was run over by Muslim converts Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale outside his barracks in Woolwich before they attacked him with knives and attempted to behead him .  Attack : Sevdet Besim , pictured , has been charged with planning an attack in Melbourne on Anzac Day  Arrest : A suburban house in Melbourne where one of the alleged terrorist plotters was arrested on Saturday  Tony Mole , from the North-West Counter-Terrorism Unit , said today : ` We have uncovered communication between an individual in the North West and a man in Australia to what we believe is a credible terrorist threat .  ` As soon as this information came to light we acted quickly with the relevant authorities here and abroad and this has resulted with officers from the NWCTU arresting a teenager .  ` The nature of the communication is currently under full assessment and subject to investigation .  ` We are continuing to work closely with the police in Australia and Lancashire and I want to reassure the public that we have not uncovered an imminent attack in the UK and there is no immediate threat towards the communities of Lancashire , the North-West and the UK . '  Australian Federal Police said : ` Victoria Police and the Australian Federal Police can confirm a link between the arrest of a 14-year-old boy in Blackburn , Lancashire in the United Kingdom on Saturday with Operation Rising , a joint Counter Terrorism Team operation .  ` The nature of the communication will form part of the investigation and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further . '  In the wake of the Melbourne arrests , Australian officials have ramped up security for Anzac Day events , while police in Britain are reviewing the arrangements for Anzac Day celebrations in the UK .  This year 's commemorations are considered particularly significant , as April 25 marks the 100th anniversary of the start of the ill-fated Gallipoli campaign , which led to the deaths of 11,500 troops from Australia and New Zealand .  Horrors : Soldiers pictured during the Gallipoli campaign , which left thousands of Allied troops dead  Commemoration : The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh pictured laying a wreath at the Cenotaph in 1990 , the 75th anniversary of the campaign ; they are set to do the same during a ceremony on Saturday  London is hosting three commemorative ceremonies on Saturday - a dawn service at Hyde Park Corner , a wreath-laying ceremony at the Cenotaph on Whitehall and a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey .  The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are due to attend the services at the Cenotaph and Westminster Abbey , while the Duke of Cambridge will join them at the Cenotaph and Princess Anne will attend the dawn service .  Security is already set to be high at all three events , with those attending told to carry photographic ID , but it could be ramped up further after the recent terror arrests .  Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu of the Metropolitan Police said over the weekend : ` Following counter-terrorism arrests in Australia this weekend and allegations of attack planning against Anzac Day commemorations and police officers in Australia , we are reviewing security plans at related events in the UK .  ` We already have protective security plans in place for major Anzac events in the UK but as a sensible precaution all forces have been asked to review security arrangements at related events to ensure they are safe and secure for the public and officers .  ` While there is no information to suggest a specific threat to related events in the UK - and the current UK threat level remains unchanged - the public should remain vigilant . '  At least 50 events commemorating Anzac Day are set to take place in other parts of the UK this weekend , including services at Manchester Cathedral , Winchester Cathedral and Oxford University .  Australian police said on Saturday that Sevdet Besim and another 18-year-old were planning to use ` edged weapons ' to attack officers in Melbourne while Anzac Day celebrations are taking place .  The teenagers were said to be inspired by Islamic extremist Numan Haider , who was shot dead by police in September last year after he attacked officers with a knife outside a Melbourne police station .  Like Britain , Australia has been suffering from an apparent upsurge in would-be jihadists as the rise of ISIS has attracted young Australians to fight in the Middle East and plot terror attacks at home .

222	Auctioneers have been condemned by Jewish leaders after selling off a haul of Nazi memorabilia in Adelaide this week .  On Thursday , about 20 items from World War I and II went under the hammer and were sold to military enthusiasts willing to fork out between $ 300 and $ 700 for a slice of Third Reich history .  Amongst the 560-item auction were Nazi flags , SS runes and a gas mask case .  About 20 Nazi items from World War I and II were sold on Thursday , including swastika-emblazoned flags  The auction came just days before Sunday 's commemoration of the 70th anniversary of D-Day that contributed to Allied forces winning World War II .  But Jewish Community Council of South Australia president Norman Schueler said auction house Mason Gray Strange should have known better than to remind survivors of the Holocaust and their families of the horrific time .  ` There are various ways of looking at this . The obvious thing - but not in this case - is that people are hoarding and keeping manifestations of an evil part of world 's history , ' he said .  ` They cling to it and see  Nazism  as unfinished work .  ` In this particular case it was literally an estate and it 's sad that someone did hoard it and everyone should realise the distress it causes .  This gas mask case were part of the 560-item auction held by Mason Gray Strange in Adelaide  ` It 's particularly irresponsible of the auctioneer to profit by it , especially when the world 's biggest auction house , eBay , does not permit this stuff to be auctioned . That 's the crux of it . '  It has been 70 years since World War II , but Mr Schueler said it did not lessen the effects the Nazi regime had on survivors .  ` They would not realise what it meant for someone to see a SS or swastika , they can not know what it means to the family , ' he said .  The Jewish community says the auction would have caused distress to survivors of the Holocaust  ` It is not only felt by Jews but a lot of Germans suffered unnecessarily because of Hitler - there were many good Germans .  ` Another thing that helps demonstrate the magnitude of what happened is that not only six million Jews were lost , but there 56 million people lost because of the war that Hitler started . '  Despite the controversy , Mason Gray Strange auctioneer Robert Hunkin said they had received no direct complaints from the community .  SS swords and daggers sold for between $ 500 - $ 700 each , and flags were sold for between $ 300 - $ 500  He said it was never the auction house 's intention to offend anyone .  ' I do understand the history  of the Holocaust  and am aware of it , but there was absolutely no feedback to express discuss or furore at the sale , ' Mr Hunkin said .  ' I am very sympathetic to the Jewish community and Mason Gray Strange had no intention of offending anyone and we regret if we have . '  Mason Gray Strange said they never meant to cause offence and were deeply sympathetic to the Jews  Mr Hunkin said he had decided to go ahead with the auction because there was a demand for military memorabilia in the past .  ` They were German memorabilia but in previous auctions we have had militaria from all different nationalities and they always sell very well , ' he said .  ` We were n't selling it to any neo-Nazis or radicals or anything like that , they were all militaria enthusiasts . '  SS swords and daggers were sold off for between $ 500 and $ 700 each and the Nazi flags went for between $ 300 and $ 500 each .

223	A suspected American member of Islamic State has been arrested at JFK airport amid fears he may be trafficking guns to the terrorist group and preparing for jihad .

Counter-terrorism agents were alerted to a series of worrying twitter posts made by Morgan while in the Middle East under the alias Abu Omar al Amreeki .  Tweeting under the alias alias Abu Omar al Amreeki , Morgan is understood to have pledged his allegiance to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi  In one post he pledged his allegiance to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi .  Others appear to suggest he had been preparing for jihad in Syria , Iraq or possibly the U.S. .  At a bail hearing last week Assistant Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Nadia Moore suggested Morgan was too dangerous to return to North Carolina on his own .  She told Brooklyn Federal Court : ` It 's possible that he traffics in guns to people in this organization  ISIS  ' , the New York Daily News reports .  Federal defender Peter Kirchheimer argued that there was no evidence to prove that Morgan was either a member of ISIS or had provided the group with material support .  But judge Ramon Reyes said the tweets had implied to him that Morgan is ` trying to go to Syria or Iraq as the next step and trying to be actively engaged ' .

224	By Amy Oliver  PUBLISHED :  08:20 EST , 13 March 2012   |  UPDATED :  08:24 EST , 13 March 2012  A former Nasa computer specialist , who claims he was sacked due to his belief that God created the universe , is due in court today .  David Coppedge , who worked as a ` team lead ' at Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory  JPL  , in California , is suing the agency after claiming he was discriminated against after talking about ` intelligent design ' and handing out DVDs on the theory at work .  Intelligent design is the belief that a higher power must have had a hand in creation because life is too complex to have developed through evolution alone .  Dismissed : David Coppedge claims he was discriminated against when he was fired from his post on the Cassini Mission last year  Coppedge lost his team lead title in 2009 and was let go last year after 15 years on the Cassini mission , which explored Saturn .  In the lawsuit , Coppedge said he believes other things led to his demotion , including his support for a state ballot measure that sought to define marriage as limited to heterosexual couples and his request to rename the annual holiday party a ` Christmas party . '  Coppedge 's attorney , William Becker , contends his client was singled out by his bosses because they perceived his belief in intelligent design to be religious .  Coppedge had a reputation around JPL as an evangelical Christian , and interactions with co-workers led some to label him as a Christian conservative , Becker said .  ` David had this reputation for being a Christian , for being a practising one . He did not go around evangelising or proselytising . But if he found out that someone was a Christian he would say , `` Oh that 's interesting , what denomination are you ? '' ' Becker said .  Lawsuit : David Coppedge worked as a ` team lead ' on the Cassini mission exploring Saturn and its many moons before being demoted in 2009 and sacked last year  ` He 's not apologising for who he is . He 's an evangelical Christian . '  In an emailed statement , JPL dismissed Mr Coppedge 's claims .  In court papers , lawyers for the California Institute of Technology , which manages JPL for NASA , said Coppedge received a written warning because his co-workers complained of harassment .  They also said Coppedge lost his ` team lead ' status because of ongoing conflicts with others .  Caltech lawyers contend Mr Coppedge was one of two Cassini technicians and among 246 JPL employees let go last year due to planned budget cuts .  The case has generated interest among supporters of intelligent design . The Alliance Defense Fund , a Christian civil rights group , and the Discovery Institute , a proponent of intelligent design , are both supporting Coppedge 's case .  NASA : The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California has landed robotic explorers on the surface of Mars and sent probes to outer planets  ` There is basically a war on anyone who dissents from Darwin and we 've seen that for several years , ' said John West , associate director of Center for Science and Culture at the Seattle-based Discovery Institute . ` This is free speech , freedom of conscience 101 . '  Meanwhile , the National Center for Science Education , which rejects intelligent design as thinly veiled creationism , is also watching the case and has posted all the legal filings on its website .  ` It would be unfortunate if the court took what seems to be a fairly straightforward employment law case and allowed it to become this tangled mess of trying to adjudicate scientific matters , ' said Josh Rosenau , NCSE 's programmes and policy director .  ` It looks like a pretty straightforward case . The mission that he was working on was winding down and he was laid off . '  At its heart this is a straightforward discrimination case , said Eugene Volokh , a professor of First Amendment law at the University of California , Los Angeles School of Law .  Space agency : David Coppedge began working for JPL as a contractor in 1996 and was hired in 2003  ` The question is whether the plaintiff was fired simply because he was wasting people 's time and bothering them in ways that would have led him to being fired regardless of whether it was about religion or whether he was treated worse based on the religiosity of his beliefs , ' said Mr Volokh . ` If he can show that , then he 's got a good case . '  Mr Coppedge , who began working for JPL as a contractor in 1996 and was hired in 2003 , is active in the intelligent design sphere and runs a website that interprets scientific discoveries through the lens of intelligent design .  His father authored an anti-evolution book and founded a Christian outreach group .  He is also a board member for Illustra Media , a company that produces video documentaries examining the scientific evidence for intelligent design . The company produces the videos that Mr Coppedge was handing out to co-workers , said Becker .  His main duties at JPL were to maintain computer networks and troubleshoot technical problems for the mission . In 2000 , he was named ` team lead ' , serving as a liaison between technicians and managers for nearly a decade before being demoted in 2009 .  He sued in April 2010 alleging religious discrimination , retaliation and harassment and amended his suit to include wrongful termination after losing his job last year .  Coppedge is seeking attorney 's fees and costs , damages for wrongful termination and a statement from the judge that his rights were violated , said Becker .

225	Sitting in a restaurant with friends , Teresa James pushed food longingly around her plate , desperate to eat but unable to stand the pain it would cause .  Her mouth felt as if it were on fire , her gums were beginning to blister and her teeth had grown so sensitive that she knew that if so much as a sip of water came into contact with them she would wince .  But Teresa 's agony was tempered with pride , because when she did manage to summon a smile , it was the most dazzling at her table .  Teresa James , 40  pictured  , believes the discomfort involved with teeth whitening is worth it for the end result of a bright smile  She had spent four hours earlier that afternoon bleaching her teeth and , as far as she was concerned , the considerable discomfort was worth it . ` Whitening has been unbearably painful at times , ' says Teresa , 40 . ` But I am obsessive about having a bright smile . '  Teresa 's regimen may sound somewhat masochistic , but she is one of an increasing number of women for whom whitening their teeth has become an integral part of their beauty routine -- as normal as colouring their hair or waxing their legs .  In America , sales of tooth whitening products have risen 300 per cent since 1996 , and the trend for excessive bleaching has grown so commonplace there that dentists have coined a new word for it -- ` bleachorexia ' .  Symptoms include burning gums , tooth infection and the conviction that , no matter how much a tooth has been whitened , it could be paler still .  Perhaps predictably , it has caught on in Britain . Almost a third of Britons are now preoccupied with whitening their teeth , and research this week revealed the highest-earning cosmetic dentists made a collective turnover of # 1 billion last year -- a 22 per cent increase from 2010 .  ` When it is done properly , tooth whitening is a simple and safe way of improving your appearance , ' says cosmetic dentist Dr Mervyn Druian . ` But if it is performed in an unregulated fashion , with the wrong product , it can cause enamel erosion , receding gums and infection . '  Tessa  pictured  is part of a growing group of women for whom teeth whitening has become an integral part of their beauty regime  Teresa , a banking finance officer from London , started whitening her teeth five years ago , influenced by the brilliant smiles of celebrities she admired . ` My own teeth looked grey in comparison after years of caffeinated drinks and they were affecting my confidence , ' she says .  The active ingredient in most professional whitening products is hydrogen peroxide , in gel form .  In October 2012 , an EU council directive made it illegal in Britain to use hydrogen peroxide -- which can cause sensitivity and burning when applied too often or at too high a dose -- in concentrations above 6 per cent , and decreed any concentration over 0.1 per cent could be administered only by a dental professional .  When carrying out the procedure , a dentist makes a mould of the patient 's teeth from which a special tray is constructed . Hydrogen peroxide gel is then squirted on to the tray via a syringe , and the tray fitted over the teeth and left for 45 minutes .  Teresa  pictured  started whitening her teeth five years ago having been influenced by the brilliant smiles of celebrities she admired  Usually , the first treatment is carried out at the surgery , then the patient is given syringes and the tray to use at home -- 45 minutes a day , for a fortnight , being the norm .  The treatment normally costs up to # 500 , so when Teresa spotted a DIY whitening kit online for # 17.99 , she was tempted . It looked authentic enough : a silicone tray and five syringes of bleach .  Teresa is n't sure how strong this hydrogen peroxide was , or indeed even if it was hydrogen peroxide . But the tray had to be moulded to her teeth -- by softening in boiling water first -- then worn overnight .  That 's when the warning bells should have sounded , says Dr Druian : ` Trays should always be properly fitted by a dentist otherwise they will never fit well and can cause leakage , which irritates gums . '  Lisa Arbiter  pictured  has been bulk-buying high-strength bleach from America to whiten her teeth every month for the past 13 years  Sure enough , the minute Teresa put the tray on , her gums started to tingle . ` I just assumed it meant it was working , ' she says .  Keen to go whiter than white , she kept the bleach on for an hour -- another mistake , says Dr Druian .  ` After 45 minutes out of the syringe , hydrogen peroxide loses effectiveness . More time wo n't make your teeth whiter , it will just lead to irritation and sensitivity . And if you have decay in your teeth , it can enter and lead to infection . '  But Teresa was so delighted with the initial results that she used her whitening kit once a week , leaving it on for longer each time . By the time she had reached her last syringe , she was bleaching for up to four hours at a time .  Lisa  pictured  was just 19 when she first tried bleaching her teeth , she now says it 's addictive and she 'll carry on doing it for ever  ` My teeth were so weak and sensitive I worried they were going to fall out . I was in agony . I knew I was being irrational , but having white teeth had become a part of my identity . It was only after an evening of not being able to eat and waiting for days for my swollen gums to go down that I realised I 'd gone too far . '  So Teresa invested in whitening toothpastes , a whitening powder and a whitening pen instead .  Ironically , the changes made to the law in 2012 , which were supposed to protect patients ' dental health , have seen a flood of illegal DIY whitening products on to the market , alongside unqualified practitioners who cater for those -- like Teresa -- who ca n't afford a dentist 's whitening service .  ` There has been an upsurge in beauticians whitening teeth with unregulated materials , ' says Dr Druian . ` Many use chlorine dioxide -- a strong antibacterial chemical sometimes found in swimming pools -- which is easier to get hold of , given the Government 's restrictions on hydrogen peroxide .  Lisa  pictured  buys # 50 boxes of syringes of a 25 per cent solution from the U.S and insists she has no pain or side effects from the treatment  ` At a high concentration , this can burn gums , leading to receding , and make tooth enamel rough and porous , which leaves it prone to further staining -- trapping users into a vicious cycle of whitening . '  Natasha Crane , from Norwich , is suffering from suspected enamel erosion after having her teeth whitened , for # 30 , by a beautician operating illegally . She had seen an advert on Facebook .  Unknown to Natasha , aged 17 , she is a year under the legal age limit for teeth whitening , but the beautician did n't check . ` She painted the whitening gel on with cotton wool , ' remembers Natasha . ` It did n't feel professional or hygienic , but this was my first experience of tooth whitening . '  As soon as the beautician removed the gel an hour later , and Natasha rinsed her mouth , her teeth felt agonisingly sensitive .  Newlywed Donna Bilson  pictured  is a recent convert to tooth bleaching but is already very taken with it  ` The beautician said this was normal , ' she recalls . ` When the pain did n't go away over the next few days I called her back , but she still said there was nothing to worry about . '  After later discovering that her beautician had been operating illegally , she reported her to the General Dental Council -- the regulatory body for British dentists .  Since then , Natasha 's teeth have grown more painful . ` They 're so sensitive that it hurts when they come into contact with fresh air , ' she says . ` I have to wear a scarf over my mouth outdoors . Eating is agony and I drink through a straw . '  Meanwhile , her teeth are starting to turn yellow because the dentine that is underneath the enamel is becoming exposed . ` Not only am I in pain , but , ironically , my teeth have never looked worse , ' says Natasha .  Beauticians practising illegally are not the only problem , however . Increasing numbers of women are ordering industrial-strength hydrogen-peroxide whitening products online from the U.S. , where there are no legal limits on levels .  Donna  pictured  and her husband , Andy , both started bleaching their teeth before they got married last October  Lisa Arbiter , 33 , has been bulk-buying high-strength bleach from America to whiten her teeth every month for the past 13 years . She was 19 and working as a beauty therapist when she first tried it .  She buys # 50 boxes of syringes of a 25 per cent solution from the U.S. , yet insists she has no side-effects other than sensitive teeth .  ` At work , having white teeth makes me look more professional , ' she says . ` And having so many pictures of ourselves plastered on social media makes it obvious who has whitened their teeth and who has n't . Un-whitened teeth look dirty .  ` Tooth whitening is addictive , and I 'll carry on bleaching mine for ever . '  According to the British Dental Health Foundation the effects of professional whitening can last for up to three years .  Although her husband stopped after their wedding , Donna  pictured  has carried on and says its part of her beauty routine now  But newlywed Donna Billson -- a recent convert to tooth bleaching -- is already hooked on doing it far more frequently than that .  Donna and her husband Andy , 34 , started whitening their teeth last January in the run-up to their wedding last October .  ` We wanted to look our best in the pictures , ' says Donna , 36 , a HR manager from Birmingham .  They ordered # 55 boxes of 20 whitening strips -- fabrics impregnated with 6 per cent hydrogen peroxide gel that users stick to their teeth for 45 minutes -- from the States .  ` Andy stopped after our wedding and says I do n't need to whiten my teeth any more either , ' says Donna . ` But I 'll carry on . It 's as much a part of my beauty routine as having my hair coloured and legs waxed .

228	By Jason Groves  UPDATED :  04:08 EST , 22 February 2012  The Leveson inquiry into Press standards has created a ` chilling atmosphere ' that threatens free speech in Britain , Michael Gove warned yesterday .  In an outspoken defence of the Press , the Education Secretary cautioned against allowing ` judges , celebrities and the establishment ' to set the boundaries of free speech because they had a vested interest in shackling the media .  Mr Gove , one of David Cameron 's closest allies , also appeared to question the Prime Minister 's decision to set up the inquiry last year , warning there was a danger it would produce ` a cure that is worse than the original disease ' .  The Leveson inquiry into Press standards has created a ` chilling atmosphere ' which threatens free speech in Britain , Michael Gove warned  Addressing a Westminster lunch , Mr Gove acknowledged the need to investigate alleged wrongdoing at the News of the World .  But he said there were already laws to prevent reporters ` going rogue ' , including specific offences of intercepting voicemail messages and bribing public officials .  Gove warned there were ` dangers ' in the wide-ranging inquiry chaired by Lord Justice Leveson  Mr Gove , a former senior journalist at The Times , said there was a natural temptation for politicians to ` succumb ' to demands for an inquiry by ` establishment ' figures in the wake of a major scandal .  But he warned there were ` dangers ' in the wide-ranging inquiry chaired by Lord Justice Leveson .  He said : ` There is a danger at the moment that what we may see are judges , celebrities , and the establishment , all of whom have an interest in taking over from the Press as arbiters of what a free Press should be , imposing either soft or hard regulation .  ` What we should be encouraging is the maximum amount of freedom of expression and the maximum amount of freedom of speech . '  He added : ` Journalists should be more assertive in making the case for Press freedom , and politicians should recognise that we have nothing to gain and everything to lose from fettering a Press which has helped keep us honest in the past and ensured that the standard of debate in this country is higher than in other jurisdictions .  ` The big picture is that there is a chilling atmosphere towards freedom of expression which emanates from the debate around Leveson .  Michael Gove was born in 1967 in Edinburgh and was educated at Robert Gordon 's College , Aberdeen and then Lady Margaret Hall , Oxford University .  He has been a journalist since he left university , working for local and national newspapers , radio and TV .  His career began as a trainee reporter for The Press and Journal in Aberdeen .  He joined The Times in 1996 as a leader writer . He also held the position of comment editor , news editor , Saturday editor and assistant editor .  Mr Gove has also worked for the BBC 's Today programme , On The Record , Scottish Television , and was a regular panelist on BBC Radio 4 's The Moral Maze and has appeared on Newsnight Review on BBC 2 .  In addition he is also a published author and has written books including a biography of Michael Portillo .  He was first elected as an MP for Surrey Heath in May 2005 . Following the 2010 General Election he was appointed Secretary of State for Education .  He is married to Sarah , a journalist at The Times .  ' I think that there are laws already in place that we should respect and principles already in place that we should uphold that are central to ensuring that this country remains free . '  Mr Gove said previous inquiries into national scandals had produced reports that ` give birth to quangos , commissions , and law-making creatures that actually generate over-regulation , over-prescription , and sometimes a cure that is worse than the original disease ' .  He said the Food Standards Agency , which was born out of the BSE crisis , had gone from being a ` body that was responsible for governing the safety of our food to one that became yet another meddlesome and nanny organisation that was telling us what we should eat and in what proportion ' .  And he said 800 pages of guidance produced in the wake of the deaths of Victoria Climbie and Baby P was ` impenetrable and has still not ensured that our children are safer today than they were two , three or five years ago ' .  He acknowledged that he had sometimes been ` irritated ' by Press coverage of his own conduct , but insisted that the media had a key role to play in holding politicians to account .  Sources close to the Education Secretary last night said he supported the decision to set up the inquiry but was concerned about the direction it had taken .  Downing Street said the Prime Minister stood by his decision to order the inquiry , but insisted he valued the role played by the media .  His official spokesman said : ` He has made very clear on a number of occasions since how important he thinks it is that we have a free Press and free media that is able to challenge governments and others . '  `` One of the things that struck me over the past few months is that a new set of stereotypes every bit as misleading and caricatured as those about politicians , have grown up around journalists and about the media and the way in which it operates . I am thinking in particular about the Leveson inquiry and the debate that has surrounded it . `` One the things that struck me about politics is that there is a particular tendency to which all politicians are tempted to succumb . In the aftermath of a specific crisis , when an undoubted wrong has been done , there is a desire to find a judge , a civil servant , a representative of the great and the good , inevitably a figure from the establishment , to inquire into what went wrong , and to make recommendations about what might be put right . `` It is a natural thing for politicians to do , but there are dangers associated with it . Sometimes the recommendations of that report may be modest , proportionate and sane . But sometimes they give birth to quangos , commissions , and law-making creatures that actually generate over-regulation , over -- prescription , and sometimes a cure that is worse than the original disease . `` If we look back at government 's response to various crises in the past , there have been some profound crises that have affected all of our consciences . And because they have affected our consciences , people have wanted to be seen to act . So for example in the immediate aftermath of BSE and the problems associated with the quality of our food , the Food Standards Agency was quite rightly set up , `` But one of the problems is that the Food Standards Agency morphed over time from being a body that was responsible for governing the safety of our food to one that became yet another meddlesome and nanny organisation that was telling us what we should eat and in what proportion . `` The same thing applied to the vetting and barring scheme and also to the Every Child Matters agenda in the wake of the tragic deaths of Victoria Climbie and subsequently Baby Peter . In both cases the tragic death of two children led to an attempt to ensure that we more effectively policed those that worked with young people but the result of that was a situation where Phillip Pullman had to apply for a Criminal Records Bureau check in order to go into a school to read to children . `` In the same way we developed guidance which is 800 pages long , is impenetrable and has still not ensured that our children are safer today than they were two , three or five years ago . `` I see the same dangers in the Leveson inquiry and in the way in which the debate on press regulation are moving now . It is undoubtedly the case that there were serious crimes which were committed , but we know those crimes were serious because they broke , if the allegations are proven , the already existing criminal law . There are laws against the interception of messages , there are laws against bribery , there are laws that prevent journalists like any other professional , going rogue . Those laws should be vigorously upheld , vigorously policed . However , there is a danger at the moment that what we may see are judges , celebrities , and the establishment , all of whom have an interest in taking over from the press as arbiters of what a free press should be , imposing either soft or hard regulation . What we should be encouraging is the maximum amount of freedom of expression and the maximum amount of freedom of speech . `` The reason why I say there is a particular danger at the moment is that because we all know that newspapers are under threat , under threat from the pressure of advertising migrating online , under threat from a variety of new news sources , that is why whenever anyone sets up a new newspaper , as Rupert Murdoch has done with the Sun on Sunday , they should be applauded and not criticised , and that is why journalists should be more assertive in making the case for press freedom , and politicians should recognise that we have nothing to gain and everything to lose from fettering a press which has helped keep us honest in the past and ensured that the standard of debate in this country is higher than in other jurisdictions .

229	And you thought romance was dead ? Then think again because everybody is in love with this kid Harry Kane .  It was the game of his life , like watching someone win the goal of the season , player of the year and world player of the year award all on the same night . It will have to end with an England call up .  Here at White Hart Lane , when Mauricio Pochettino 's team put away their great London rivals Chelsea 5-3 , Kane was magnificent .  VIDEO Scroll down to see Pochettino on Kane 's England chances  Harry Kane was in sensational form on New Year 's Day as he scored twice in the 5-3 win over Chelsea  He scored twice , won a penalty for Andros Townsend to convert in first half injury time and set up the fifth for Nacer Chadli .  At the final whistle this remarkable young man milked the moment , taking his time to leave his field of dreams and lapping up the applause from Tottenham supporters . He was entitled to do so .  Kane owns the place now , the main man in this team as they continue their charge up the table . They have to fancy themselves for fourth .  In a performance that most analysts would agree was borderline ` complete ' , Kane made mugs of two of the best defenders in English football .  He embarrassed Gary Cahill to such an extent that the Chelsea defender booted Kane in the back in frustration when things were going against them . For good measure , Cahill then kicked his calf .  Gary Cahill kicks Kane in the back as the game was slipping out of Chelsea 's reach  ` I did n't see it , but he did complain afterwards that his back is a little bit sore , ' revealed Pochettino .  What a silly boy , losing his rag with Kane because this young Spurs striker had turned him this way and that for 90 , frankly , mesmerising minutes .  Terry , perhaps the finest English central defender of his generation , was way off the pace here . Kane murdered the pair of them .  ` It shows how good we are , scoring five goals against one of the best defences in the world and it is all coming together , ' claimed Kane .  ` We are delighted , we want to keep this run going . I am enjoying it , especially as we get so much stick from the Chelsea supporters . ' This time we only ever heard from Tottenham , chirping up when Kane scored a magnificent equaliser from the edge of the area .  What an iconic figure he has become , a talisman in this Tottenham team as they try to make a move on the top four . They are on their way there .  Kane is sent tumbling by Cahill to earn Tottenham a penalty in first-half stoppage time  He scores goals in every competition : Europa League , Capital One Cup and Premier League . On Monday , he ca n't wait to get his teeth stuck into Burnley .  Kane has scored 17 times now and he will be under consideration for a place in the England squad when Roy Hodgson finally returns from an extra long Christmas holiday .  Wherever he is in the world England 's head coach will have heard about this because this remarkable young man is one of the most talked about footballers in the Premier League at this moment .  ` We need to be careful with him , but we can not hide him away , ' admitted Pochettino after his first ever victory against a team put out by Jose Mourinho .  Nacer Chadli  right  celebrates with Kane after scoring Tottenham 's fifth goal  ` The national team is not my decision , but we try to improve him every day and if the England coach believes in him and wants to give him the opportunity it is good .  ` Harry is still young , but in the last few months he has had the chance to play more and show his qualities . We are happy with that . ' In the final moments , when Kane was motioning with his arms to tell his team-mates to calm down and see this extraordinary game out , it was like watching a future Tottenham captain .  He is having that effect around the place , galvanising the Tottenham supporters as they start to make an impression in the higher reaches of the table .  Credit to them because even when they went a goal down at White Hart Lane , they stayed with their team . What a difference that made .  Kane and team-mate Nabil Bentaleb celebrate at the final whistle as Tottenham moved up to fifth  They believed in them , waiting patiently for Kane to take this game by the scruff of the neck . The kid is n't afraid of anyone .  Tottenham fans show so much passion for him here , belting out his name at the top of their voices after his second beat Thibaut Courtois in the 52nd minute .  On Monday , in an FA Cup third round tie with Burnley , the love affair continues .  	  Tottenham beat Chelsea 5-3 at White Hart Lane on New Year 's Day    Spurs striker Harry Kane was man of the match after scoring twice    Kane is hotly tipped to be in Roy Hodgson 's next England squad	And you thought romance was dead ?

233	By Daily Mail Reporter  PUBLISHED :  10:40 EST , 10 June 2012   |  UPDATED :  02:02 EST , 11 June 2012  The sharp increase in the number of women over 30 who are having abortions is due in part to the recent financial crisis , experts have claimed .  Terminations carried out by women between 30 and 34 increased by 10 per cent between 2009 and 2011 , according to Department of Health figures .  Increased financial pressure , more widely available IVF treatment allowing women to have children later , and career ambitions are all said to have contributed to the rise , according to experts .  Pregnancy scare : The number of abortions in England and Wales has risen for the second year running , according to the Department Of Health  Experts said one reason was many 30-something women believe they could delay motherhood by using IVF in their 40s .  Only last month it emerged that women in their early 40s could be given fertility treatment for free on the NHS despite success rates at this age being low .  Tracey McNeil , UK director of Marie Stopes , the sexual health charity , told the Sunday Times : ` There is good evidence that , in a recession , women delay marriage and taking out mortgages into their late 20s .  ` That in turn delays them having families until their early or mid-thirties .  ` If they have an unplanned pregnancy at a certain stage in their career , or have just embarked on a mortgage and ca n't afford maternity leave , they may consider termination . '  Josephine Quintavalle , of pressure group Comment on Reproductive Ethics , said : ` At some stage these women are going to decide they really want children and then by that stage it may be too late .  ` Meeting women 's needs ' : Ann Furedi said that there was no ` right ' number of abortions  ` It just seems to be abortion on demand . It 's like a form of contraception .  ` Without making judgement , you would think that by this age women should know better . It may be that because IVF is available they can always delay having a baby . ' Last year there were 29,579 abortions carried out on women aged 30 to 34 compared with 27,978 in 2010 -- a rise of 1,601 .  In contrast , the number of those aged between 25 and 29 rose by under 4 per cent , from 40,800 in 2010 to 42,321 last year .  For all age groups , 189,931 terminations were carried out in 2011 -- an increase of 0.2 per cent in a year .  Around 36 per cent were carried out on women who had had an abortion . Only last week it emerged that some teenagers have already had eight abortions , fuelling concerns many think of it as a form of contraception .  Figures revealed under the Freedom of Information Act showed that 5,300 girls last year had a ` repeat ' abortion . Ann Furedi , of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service , said : ` Abortion is a service that a third of women will need in the course of their reproductive lifetimes so they can plan the timing and size of their families , and play a role in society .  By age : The percentage of women who had one of more abortions in England and Wales in 2011  ` There is no `` right '' number of abortions above and beyond ensuring that every woman who needs to end an unwanted pregnancy can do so . '  Julie Bentley , of the Family Planning Association , said : ` The number of abortions has n't changed significantly in the past few years and this is to be welcomed .  ` However , we do know cracks are beginning to appear in contraception services . If we are going to bring down abortion numbers , this needs to change . Contraception is an essential not a luxury . '  Public health minister Anne Milton said : ` Having an abortion can be traumatic and stressful and should never be seen as a form of contraception . '  Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists vice president David Richmond , said : ` We need to continue to reduce the need for abortion in the first place particularly for repeat abortions .

234	By Darren Boyle  A young mother died from a large abscess on her brain six weeks after being sent home by her GP with antibiotics to treat earache , an inquest has heard .  Tragic Zoe Adams , 28 , died last year after medics put her symptoms - including ear and head pain , and discharge from her left ear - down to a ` relatively minor ' infection .  But a coroner concluded that doctors could n't have done any more to save the ` extremely unlucky ' mother-of-three , who collapsed and died in Wythenshawe Hospital on March 21 last year .  Tragic mum Zoe Adams , 28 , who died from a large abscess on her brain six weeks after her GP treated her for an ear infection .  Doctors believe the infection spread from Zoe Adams ' ear to her brain despite being treated by a course of antibiotics  The mother-of-three was seen by two further doctors who all agreed with the ear infection diagnosis because Zoe Adams did not show any symptoms alerting them to the killer brain bug  A top ear , nose and throat surgeon , Andrew Camilleri , who carried out an investigation for the hospital into Ms Adams ' death , told the inquest that there was around a one-in-4 ,000 chance of an ear infection leading to a brain abscess .  He said he was satisfied the hospital had taken all the steps possible to treat Miss Adams and said by looking at her , no-one would have suspected she had a brain abscess .  The court heard from medics - two doctors who had seen Ms Adams in the weeks before her death and two nurses who had taken calls from her - who said Ms Adams ' symptoms were consistent with nothing more than an ear infection .  A brain abscess is a rare and life-threatening condition caused when an infection travels from another part of the body to the brain .  Only three people per million will contract the deadly bug each year .  With early diagnosis , nine out of ten patients are expected to survive .  Patients suffering a brain abscess often develop a headache which is so severe it is not helped by pain killers .  The infection can often cause changes in a patient 's mental state and brings a fever with temperatures in excess of 38c  A patient may also suffer seizures as the infection attacks the brain .  A brain abscess can be caused by sinusitis and even a dental infection that attacks the brain .  In some cases , a brain abscess can be caused by a serious head injury leading to a fractured skull allowing the infection to pass into the brain tissue .  Patients diagnosed with a brain abscess will be treated with anti-biotics , surgery and in some cases anti-fungals .  The earlier a patient is treated , the less chance of long-term complications .  Patients can suffer from seizures and epilepsy  Source : NHS Direct  In fact , the mother-of-three had developed a middle ear infection which had led to a large 4cm abscess developing on the left side of her brain .  The hearing was told the tragedy began on February 12 last year after Miss Adams , from Rusholme , Manchester went to see her GP Dr Praful Patel complaining of pains in her ear .  The doctor examined her ear including the bone structure but thought the symptoms pointed to an outer ear infection .  He prescribed her with antibiotics and asked her to come back in three weeks if she did not get any better .  On March 1 Miss Adams called a triage nurse working for the Out-of-Hours Go To Doc service saying her ear was ` very painful ' and was ` nine out of ten ' on the pain scale .  She was referred to a doctor at an out-of-hours surgery based at Wythenshawe Hospital who thought it was an infection of the middle ear but prescribed antibiotics and advised her to come back in a few days if the pain persisted or became worse .  On March 16 , Miss Adams spoke to another out-of-hours nurse complaining of headache and earache and four days later she was admitted to hospital .  The Manchester hearing was told after her admission , she did not display signs of illness , such as high temperature or changed mental state , that could have prompted doctors to send her for a brain scan that might have discovered the abscess .  Although she was seen to be very distant the night before she died , that was put down to the pressures of coping with young children .  She last seen alive going to the toilet at around 4am after being kept in hospital overnight . She died on the ward later that day .  Coroner Nigel Meadows said Zoe Adams was ` incredibly unlucky ' saying the lack of other symptoms gave doctors little chance of diagnosing a brain abscess because of her ` robust constitution '  Recording a verdict of death by natural causes , Coroner Nigel Meadows said the diagnosis of a `` relatively minor '' ear infection by Dr Patel had been ` completely appropriate ' .  Mr Meadows said the out-of-hours service had taken a sensibly cautious approach to Miss Adams ' condition and he thought they could not have done anymore to prevent her death .  Mr Meadows said Miss Adams did not display any normal signs of somebody with a cerebral abscess and added : ` Zoe has just been extremely unlucky to contract this infection and to have a robust constitution . ` He added : ` There was no evidence that her condition justified a CT scan . It would be unrealistic to expect that the hospital perform a CT scan on everybody who has a ear infection .  ` Even if she was given a emergency CT scan the night she died then there is also no evidence to suggest she would have been able to be saved .  ` It is a very unfortunate series of events . The vast majority of people who have ear infections do n't have a cerebral abscess . She has been extremely unlucky to contract this infection . ` He added : ` Zoe has just been extremely unlucky to contract this infection and to have a robust constitution -LSB- that meant doctors could not tell she had an abscess -RSB- . '  Speaking afterwards , Ms Adams ' mum , Michelle Holt , said she accepted the verdict , adding : ` It 's been a very , very hard time . My daughter was like me and had a very strong pain threshold . '  Brain abcesses are incredibly rare in Britain with most neurosurgeons expecting to treat at most four patients a year .  Friends of Zoe Adams took to Facebook to pay tribute to the tragic mum-of-three who died after contracting the rare brain condition  	  Medics believed Zoe Adams was only suffering a ` relatively minor ' ear infection    The mother-of-three had developed a 4cm brain abscess without showing clear symptoms    Coroner Nigel Meadows said Ms Adams ' ` strong constitutions ' made diagnosis harder    Mother claims Zoe had a ` very strong pain threshold '	By Darren Boyle  A young mother died from a large abscess on her brain six weeks after being sent home by her GP with antibiotics to treat earache , an inquest has heard .

235	Glenis Ludlow was awarded # 13,500 in compensation after she fell violently ill on a family holiday in Egypt  A pensioner who fell seriously ill along with her granddaughter on a ` nightmare ' holiday to Egypt has told how she would never return to the country again .  Glenis Ludlow , 71 , stayed at the four-star Tropicana Splash Resort , which has now changed its name to the Sea Beach Resort & Aqua Park , in Sharm El-Sheikh , along with her granddaughter Natasha for a summer holiday .  However , only three days in the pensioner fell seriously ill with gastric illness that saw her bed-ridden for the majority of the two-week break .  The grandmother was one of 73 guests who fell ill at the four-star hotel and have been given a pay-out of # 350,000 by tour operator First Choice Holidays and Flights Limited .  Ms Ludlow told MailOnline Travel : ` Every year I have my granddaughter who flies in from Spain , and we book a holiday together , often to places with a waterpark , ' she said .  ` I 'm disabled , and so I made sure to ask the operator if they are disabled friendly , which they said the resort was .  ` But around the pool for example , there were broken tiles and totally inadequate handrails , not to mention the water was absolutely filthy . '  Three days into the holiday , taken at the end of July , 2012 , Ms Ludlow became sick , suffering from vomiting and diarrhoea .  She explained : ` As soon as we got there I wanted a shower , but when I went in and turned on the water , the smell was horrific , it smelt like a cesspit in there .  ` That continued for the whole holiday ; the staff poured disinfectant down , but all that did was make the smell in the whole room unbearable .  ` There were flies all around the restaurant , birds flying around and leaving droppings , and the toilets in the hotel were absolutely filthy , full of mould and dirt .  ' I just think the people who worked there were not properly trained . '  Ms Ludlow was awarded # 13,500 in compensation , while her granddaughter secured # 2,500 .  Birds were frequently in the restaurant at the Tropicana Splash Resort in Sharm El-Sheikh  Of the 73 holidaymakers affected , a judge at Birmingham County Court approved settlements for 32 children , with some receiving damages of up to # 20,000 each .  Dozens of people needed medical treatment and some guests contracted serious infections such as Salmonella poisoning and Cryptosporidium .  Jatinder Paul , a solicitor and international personal injury lawyer at Irwin Mitchell who represented the holidaymakers , said : ` We received dozens of complaints from holidaymakers who stayed at the Tropicana Sea Beach Splash Resort during 2012 and in seeking to secure them justice for their illnesses and ruined holidays we were able to obtain expert evidence which was supportive to their claims , despite the refusal by First Choice to neither admit or deny liability .  ` There were guests that were diagnosed with Salmonella food poisoning and Cryptosporidium , and a number of the guests that suffered illness suffered from symptoms including stomach cramps , diarrhoea , vomiting and lethargy ; these illnesses have had a debilitating long term impact on the health of some of our clients .  The Tropicana Splash Resort , which has now changed its name to the Sea Beach Resort & Aqua Park , in Sharm El-Sheikh , where 32 children fell ill back in 2012  ` We understand that First Choice no longer advertises this resort on their website but our clients were unfortunate enough to go there and have terrible experiences as a result .  ` Many guests had to seek medical assistance whilst abroad and upon returning home , and they are now understandably relieved to have received compensation for the pain and suffering that they have gone through , re-imbursement of their financial losses and expenses and damages for their ruined holidays .  ` Despite First Choice 's initial unwillingness to engage constructively with us to resolve these claims , we are delighted that our clients continued to instruct us to fight for them and that we have been able to negotiate a fair financial settlement for them . '  Bathroom facilities were not up to scratch during Ms Ludlow 's 2012 stay at the Tropicana Splash Resort in Sharm El-Sheikh  Louise Baldwin , 31 , from Llanharan , in Mid Glamorgan , also booked a two week holiday at the resort with her husband Darryn and their son Callum to celebrate Louise 's 30th birthday and Darryn 's 40th .  During their stay at the hotel the family were struck with stomach cramps , sickness , diarrhoea and a fever which left them largely confined to their hotel rooms .  Catering manager Louise said : ` We booked this holiday to celebrate our milestone birthdays in style but were bitterly disappointed when all three of us suffered from illness during our stay at the hotel .  ` We were horrified at the conditions at what was supposed to be a ` luxury ' hotel ; we were bitterly disappointed as this was meant to be a special holiday for us all and it was completely ruined .  ` We had actually pre booked another holiday the following year to the resort , but as a result of our experience there we wanted to change the destination with First Choice and to add insult to injury we were told by the tour operator that we would be charged for this , but we took matters into our own hands and contacted the TV programme X-Ray  the Welsh version of Watchdog  and First Choice eventually waived the charges .  ` We are pleased and relieved that with the help of our legal team at Irwin Mitchell that we have now received a settlement and justice for our holiday which was ruined whilst staying at the Tropicana Sea Splash Resort . We can now move forward from this and put the ordeal behind us . '  MailOnline Travel have contacted Thomson , who have said they do not comment on settlements .

236	By Steve Robson  PUBLISHED :  14:48 EST , 31 May 2013   |  UPDATED :  19:51 EST , 31 May 2013  Security : A 16-year-old Bangladeshi actress has been chosen to play Malala Yousafzai , pictured , in a new film about her extraordinary story  A 16-year-old Bangladeshi student has been chosen to play the role of Malala Yousafzai in a new film about the young activist who was shot by the Taliban .  Fatima Sheikh , who has no acting experience , was selected by Indian director Amjad Khan to play the schoolgirl in an upcoming biopic which chronicles her extraordinary story .  But the actress 's parents , from Dhaka , are so terrified of revenge attacks by the Taliban they have insisted her face is not revealed until midway through filming .  After weeks of feverish speculation , Khan gave way to pressure and revealed the girl 's name to the Times of India .  But the only picture to be released shows the student wearing a niqab with just a narrow slit for her eyes .  No further picture or information about her will be revealed until filming is well underway .  Malala Yousafzai has become a global icon following her heroic struggle for the rights of girls to be educated in Pakistan 's Swat Valley which almost cost her her life .  After the Taliban gained control of the area in 2007 , she began writing a blog for the BBC under the pseudonym ` Gul Makai ' .  The terrorist militia operated a regime based on fear and imposed their will on residents by forcing men to grow beards , preventing women from going to the market and blowing up many schools - the majority for girls .  Global icon : Malala was 14 when she was shot by the Taliban for speaking up for women 's rights to education  Malala wrote about these practices in the journal when she was just 11 . After the Taliban were pushed out of the valley in 2009 by the Pakistani military , she became even more outspoken in advocating for girls ' education .  She appeared frequently in the media and was given one of the country 's highest honours for civilians for her bravery .  In October last year , a Taliban hitman burst onto her school bus in Swat , northern Pakistan , and shot the 14-year-old at point-blank range .  The bullet entered just above her left eye and ran along her jaw , ` grazing ' her brain .  It was later removed by surgeons in Pakistan before she was flown to the UK for specialist treatment at Birmingham 's Queen Elizabeth Hospital .  Heroic struggle : Malala survived the assassination attempt and now lives in Birmingham with her family . She has been nominated for this year 's Nobel Prize for Peace  Indian director Amjad Khan said he had to keep the name of the actress playing Malala secret until this point at her family 's request  Malala 's attempted assassination was condemned by politicians across the world and she was inundated with messages of support from members of the public and celebrities alike .  She now attends Edgbaston High School in Birmingham and has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize .  Amjad Khan said his film will be called ` Gul Makai ' in reference to Malala 's original blog and filming will take place in London , Pakistan , Iran and India .  He said he located Fatima Sheikh through a friend and flew out to Dhaka to do a screen test .  ` She is a student . She looks like Malala - but there are security issues , ' he told The Independent .  Filming is expected to start in the middle of July .  Malala is due to publish an account of her life later this year entitle ' I am Malala ' .

238	A father lets out a sob of ecstatic relief as he clutches his son . A mother , her face a picture of joy , holds her precious child as she flees the scene of a bloody hostage drama in Paris that cost the lives of four innocent people .  In 15 astonishing minutes , police brought a dramatic end to two sieges after three days of terror had paralysed the French capital .  Police commandos stormed a Jewish grocery store in a hail of bullets and stun grenades , killing an Al Qaeda-linked gunman who was holding 15 hostages .  Twelve minutes earlier , and only 25 miles away , another stand-off ended with the deaths of Charlie Hebdo killers , Said and Cherif Kouachi .  Firing their Kalashnikovs , they charged straight into the guns of hundreds of soldiers and police surrounding their final hideout .  Scroll down for video .  Relief : Two hostages leave with their young child  left  and a man carrying a small child is seen fleeing from the ordeal  right  after police stormed the kosher grocery store in eastern Paris  Going in : Special forces storm the Jewish grocery to the east of Paris where terrorist Amedey Coulibaly had taken hostages  Chilling : The body of a man can be seen at the entrance of the Jewish supermarket after it was stormed by commandos  Terrified : Hostages - who had been held for hours with Coulibaly threatening to kill them - flee from the shop , crying with relief  Running to safety : Police escort seven hostages freed from the kosher grocers , including one woman who had to be carried  The grocery store terrorist , Amedy Coulibaly , 32 , gave an interview to a French TV station at the height of the siege in which he swore allegiance to Islamic State and claimed the three days of mayhem had been ` synchronised ' .  Coulibaly confirmed he had shot a policewoman in the south of Paris on Thursday . ` Them Charlie Hebdo ; me the police , ' he said .  One of his hostages had left a telephone line open so police could hear what was happening in the shop and moved in when the gunman began to pray .  The Kouachi brothers , who were trained by Al Qaeda in Yemen , had a hostage they did not know about during their nine-hour siege at a printworks in Dammartin-en-Goele , near Charles de Gaulle airport , northeast of Paris .  A 27-year-old graphic designer hid inside a box with his phone for more than six hours and updated police on his phone .  Another man , Michel Catalano , who the brothers held during the stand-off , was able to walk to safety helped by police . The terrorists had told negotiators they wanted to ` die as martyrs ' before mounting their fatal charge .  Last night French president Francois Hollande spoke to the nation promising ` all necessary measures will be used ' to protect the French people and called on them to remain united in ` these difficult times ' .  He said the attacks had been carried out by fanatics who had nothing to do with Islam and said the assault on the grocery shop was ` anti-semitic ' .  The country must remain vigilant against the possibility of further attacks , he stressed .  The dual assaults brought to an end France 's biggest security operation with nearly 90,000 police and soldiers deployed initially to hunt down the brothers , and then Coulibaly , after he had shot dead the 27-year-old policewoman .  Millions had watched gripped on television as the manhunt for the terrorists had ended in bloody shootouts , car chases and sieges .  At one point seven helicopters and more than 50 police and military vehicles had been involved in a high-speed chase during which shots were fired after the Kouachis broke cover from a forest where they had been sheltering 50 miles north east of Paris .  Dead : Amedey Coulibaly was shot dead after taking at least six hostages at a grocery store in east Paris . He is believed to be have been working with his girlfriend Hayat Boumeddiene  right  who was said to be ` armed and dangerous '  Dead : Cherif Kouachi  left  , 32 , and his brother Said  right  were killed in a firefight with French special forces at a industrial site  Bloody climax : A huge ball of fire erupts amid gunfire and explosions as French special forces shoot dead the two Charlie Hebdo gunmen  In their sights : Police train their weapons on the building where the Charlie Hebdo gunmen were holed up with a hostage in Dammartin-en-Goele  Algerian secret services warned France of an imminent attack 24 hours before the Paris atrocity , it was claimed last night .  Officials told their French counterparts that a ` major terrorist operation was in preparation on French territory ' on January 6 , according to TV station iTele .  The claim is particularly interesting because the Kouachi brothers behind the massacre at the Charlie Hebdo offices were French nationals of Algerian descent .  They were radicalised by the Buttes-Chaumont jihadist recruitment cell , primarily made up of Franco-Algerians .  They were forced in to the industrial estate at Dammartin-en-Goele where they made their last stand .  Local residents were evacuated or ordered to lock themselves in their homes as what was described as ` a small army ' of soldiers and police surrounded them , throwing a cordon around the area .  ` They said they want to die as martyrs , ' Yves Albarello , a local politician who was inside the command post , claimed .  Meanwhile , across Paris , Coulibaly , brandishing his Kalashnikov , wearing a bullet proof vest and firing at shoppers , had stormed the kosher supermarket near the Porte de Vincennes , shooting or taking hostage those inside .  Police said he was accompanied by a woman called Hayat Boumeddiene , 26 . They were described as ` armed and dangerous . '  Her fate was unknown last night amid reports that she was on the run . Unknown to the gunman , several Jewish families were hiding in a freezing store room below , listening to the gunfire and terror above .  It appeared that at one point Coulibaly and the Kouachis were in contact and police shut down all communications around the industrial site .  Coulibaly warned a hostage negotiator that if the brothers were killed , he would open fire on his hostages . One woman trapped inside telephoned her mother to say : ` I am in the shop . I love you . '  Explosion : The street is rocked during the final stages of the siege which left four hostages dead  Front door : Officers were also seen pouring in through the front door at the denouement of the siege  Assault force : Special forces line up to enter the premises through a backdoor as the street is rocked by explosions  Police locked down the area , swamping it with hundreds of security forces . Snipers could be seen on rooftops and at windows looking for a clear shot at Coulibaly .  Last night there was a huge sense of relief in the French capital , mixed with disbelief and fears of more copycat strikes .  There were difficult questions too for the intelligence services as to why they had stopped their surveillance on the Kouachi brothers when their jihadi terror links going back eight years were so well known .  In a telephone call yesterday , Cherif Kouachi admitted he had been funded by a network loyal to Anwar al-Awlaki , the former American-born leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula who was killed by a drone strike in 2011 in Yemen .  Frantic : Police rush to the scene of the hostage-taking at an industrial estate in Dammartin-en-Goele around 25 miles from Paris  Siege : The gunmen are surrounded by police commandos who have begun negotiations to try to secure the release of the hostage  Trapped : The brothers were cornered in the premises of a printing firm after leading police on a dramatic car chase  Scoping it out : Police and armed forces take up positions in Dammartin-en-Goele after landing by helicopter in fields near the hostage scene  Hacker group Anonymous ` declared war ' on Islamist terrorists last night saying they would smash their online networks . The group said it would track down and close social media accounts of militants , in a video and statement published online .  A figure wearing the group 's symbolic Guy Fawkes mask appeared seated in front of a desk with the hashtag #OpCharlieHebdo .  Speaking in French and with his voice obscured electronically , he said : ` We are declaring war against you , the terrorists . '  How three days of terror unfolded after gunmen first stormed the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris on Wednesday  Holed up : The gunmen escaped on foot into a small printing business  above  called Creating Trend Discovery , just before 9am GMT  In a separate statement posted online the group said ` freedom of expression has suffered inhuman assault ... and it is our duty to react ' .  The move is a novel departure for Anonymous which has previously carried out attacks on government , religious and corporate websites . Many of them were so-called ` denial-of-service ' attacks .  Two of the terrorists gave interviews by phone as the final moments of the sieges played out around Paris yesterday .  From his printworks hideout , Cherif Kouachi told a radio journalist : ` I am a defender of the Prophet . I was sent by Al Qaeda of Yemen .  ` I 'm financed by Imam Anwar al-Awlaki . Anwar is a predicateur -LSB- preacher -RSB- . He has lived in the Yemen . He is one of the thinking heads of Al Qaeda . '  Al-Awlaki , who was killed in 2011 in Yemen by a US drone strike , was one of Al Qaeda 's top recruiters , US officials say .  The French reporter who spoke to Kouachi said his manner was calm and determined , and he denied killing civilians . Chillingly , the terrorist insisted he did not see the murdered journalists at Charlie Hebdo as civilians , but merely as ` targets ' .  Astonishingly , another journalist was also able to speak on the phone to Amedy Coulibaly , who had taken shoppers hostage at a kosher grocery in Porte de Vincennes .  In the midst of the siege , the reporter asked Coulibaly : ` Are you in contact with the two brothers ? ' The gunman replied : ` Yes , we made contact before the operations . '  He confirmed he had shot a policewoman in Paris the previous day , swore allegiance to Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant , and said the attacks were ` synchronised ' .  ` Them Charlie Hebdo ; me the police , ' Coulibaly explained .  Terrified hostages also reportedly called friends and family from the kosher deli . A woman told the French Europe 1 TV station she had received a call from her daughter , telling her : ` I am in the shop , I love you .

239	A disabled Lottery winner says he wishes he had never won his # 20,000 prize after his new-found wealth meant his benefits were cancelled .  George Grant , 54 , hoped go on a luxury holiday in Nashville , Tennessee after winning the five-figure sum on a National Lottery Lucky Dip ticket .  But he says he is instead counting the cost after the windfall meant he no longer qualifies for income support , housing benefit , a council tax reduction or any other means-tested handouts .  George Grant wishes he had never won # 20,000 on the lottery after some of his benefits were cancelled  Mr Grant , of Golspie in northern Scotland , is now deemed to have savings over the government 's # 16,000 limit and can only make what benefit bosses describe as ` reasonable expenditure ' .  He said : ' I wish I 'd never won this money , the hassle it has caused me . I wo n't be buying a ticket again . '  Mr Grant has been unable to work since he was left with mobility problems following a motorbike accident in October 1980 , when he was just 21 .  He had previously earned a living as a youth leader and disc jockey but since the accident has been forced to live on benefits .  He receives disability living allowance  DLA  as well as housing benefit and council tax benefit .  Mr Grant said : ` That accident stopped everything in its tracks . I 've been buying tickets since the lottery started in 1994 and have won # 10 here and there but nothing major until now . '  He purchased a Lucky Dip ticket from the Nisa store on Golspie 's Main Street earlier this month and went back on Saturday to find out if he 'd won anything .  He said : ' I went into the shop and handed the ticket over . The machine made a funny noise and I thought it was another # 10 win but the sales assistant said `` I think you 've won a wee bit more than # 10 '' .  ` When he said that , I looked out the window for the pink elephants to fly . '  Benefits rules mean that claimants can not spend any windfall in order to become entitled to handouts again  It turned out that he had won # 20,000 on the raffle , run as part of the Lucky Dip game . The Nisa store was unable to pay out the winnings and George had to go to another store where he was given a cheque .  His immediate thoughts were that he would pay off debts he owes to relatives and possibly visit Nashville , a place he has always wanted to visit because of his love of music .  Government rules state that anyone with savings over # 16,000 is not entitled to means-tested benefits such as income support , housing benefit and council tax reduction .  However , they can still receive benefits which are not means-tested , such as disability living allowance and incapacity benefit .  A complicated formula is in place to calculate benefit entitlement for people with savings of between # 6000 and # 16,000 , while anyone with savings under # 6000 can receive benefits , if eligible .  There are also rules in place to prevent anyone , such as Mr Grant , who comes into an inheritance or windfall , from spending it in order to retain means-tested benefit .  He has already been told that he will have to account for any expenditures he makes .  He said : ' I thought how great it was to finally have some money and be debt-free .  ` I 've always wanted to go to Nashville . I 've never been abroad and have only flown once and that was off the back of a motorbike .  ` The furthest I 've travelled has been to London . I was never meant to have any money . '  Richard Gale , from Mr Grant 's local Citizens ' Advice Bureau  CAB  manager , said : ` This is a great win for George .  ` The information that I have is that it is all a matter of what is considered to be `` reasonable expenditure '' and that requires a discussion between the benefit providers and the claimant .  ` In this case that would be George , and the CAB would be happy to work with him , should he wish , to ensure that he complies with the benefit regulations and does not fall foul of any sanctions that may result from his windfall and to help him achieve his goals .

240	A school governors ' chairman says he was forced to quit his post after joining Ukip because they political party 's policies are ` against it 's ethos . '  Mike Ward claims he was asked to step down from his role as Head of Governors at Eskdale School in Whitby , North Yorkshire after he became a member of Ukip .  The Scarborough councillor , 70 , who had previously stood as an independent , said he was invited to a meeting with headteacher Sue Whelan after his political switch was reported in local media .  Resigned : Mike Ward  left  claims he was asked to step down from his role as Head of Governors at Eskdale School in Whitby , North Yorkshire , by headteacher Sue Whelan  right  after he became a member of Ukip  ' I had been a governor at Eskdale School for eight years and chair for five years when , as a Scarborough Councillor , I recently joined Ukip , ' said the retired teacher .  ` After this was reported in the local paper I was called in to school to see the head . She then asked me to resign saying Ukip 's policies were against the ethos of the school .  ' I was astonished as politics had never played a part in my time as a governor but after some soul searching over the weekend and not wishing to cause the school any further issues I tendered my resignation which she accepted .  ` Dedicated ' : Mr Ward has been a governor at Eskdale School for eight years , and chairman of the board for the past five years . He says politics had ` never played a part ' in his time at the school  Desire for change : Mr Ward said the school 's pupils ` must come first ' , and says he is ` neither extremist or racist ' , but is ` strongly advocating change '  ` The pupils must come first .  ' I am neither extremist or racist . I have always been independent , strongly advocating change .  ` Ukip is fully committed to putting residents , their wishes and needs , first .  ` More common sense must be applied to local decision making . It is the party for change , neither left or right but rather right from wrong . '  Party leader Nigel Farage said it was ` atrocious ' that Mr Ward had been asked to resign .  ` It 's atrocious that Cllr Mike Ward a long standing , conscientious and dedicated School Governor has been forced to resign as a Governor of Eskdale School , a school he deeply cares for , just because he is a member of Ukip , ' said Mr Farage .  Anger : Party leader Nigel Farage  pictured  said it was ` atrocious ' that Mr Ward had been asked to resign  ` Mike is a decent and honourable man who has always had the interests of the School and the wider community at the forefront of his mind and it is absolutely disgraceful that he has been treated in this way .  ` This is discrimination pure and simple and I find it astounding that the head teacher has taken it upon herself to oust him . Questions need to be asked about why this has happened .  ` In the meantime I stand with Mike and I can only hope the School sees sense and reinstates him . '  Mr Ward stepped down from the governing panel claiming his decision made him ` persona non grata ' at the school , which Ofsted inspectors ruled earlier this year requires improvement , having previously branded it ` outstanding ' .  Inquiry : Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall has called for a full independent inquiry into Mr Ward 's resignation , and says he should be reinstated  Mr Ward has been a school governor at Eskdale for eight years and chairman for the last five . His teaching career included a two year stint in Filey .  A complaint by a member of the public about his resignation has led to an internal investigation by the school into his resignation .  But Ukip has now called for a full independent inquiry - and for Mr Ward to be reinstated , despite his resignation .  ` This is an outrage , Mike has been a dedicated governor for years and it is totally unacceptable that membership of UKIP should be considered to be incompatible with being a governor , ' said the party 's deputy leader Paul Nuttall .  ` This is discrimination against a conscientious man who has worked tirelessly for the school and it is a disgrace that the head teacher has taken it upon herself to oust him . He purely has the interests of the school and local youngsters at heart .  ` There must be a full independent inquiry into this debacle and Mike should be re-instated . He is a former teacher and university lecturer and I 'm sure his fellow governors had no problems with his completely unrelated political membership .  ` Everyone is entitled to their own political views and I 'm sure the other governors have theirs and possibly even belong to a political party but like Mike just concentrate on seeking the best for Eskdale School . '  Despite initially vowing to carry out a full investigation , North Yorkshire County Council has now distanced itself from any inquiry .  A council spokesperson said : ` North Yorkshire County Council has received a complaint from a member of the public about the resignation of the chair of governors at Eskdale School in Whitby .  ` This is a matter for consideration not by the County Council but by the school 's governing body .  ` We understand that the governing body is taking this complaint seriously and will respond to the complainant .

242	A force of up to 100 Paras is being sent to join the battle against Islamic State  IS  with authority to shoot and kill when needed .  The elite troops are the first detachment of British soldiers to go to Iraq in a fighting role since 2009 .  The Paras ' job will be to protect around 350 British military instructors who are being sent out in January to train the Iraqi army and Kurdish peshmerga forces .  Scroll down for video  Shoot to kill : Up to 100 British Paras are being sent to Iraq to join the battle against ISIS  Should they come under attack from IS , the Paras -- expected to be drawn from the regiment 's second battalion -- will be authorised to shoot and kill the jihadis .  With the Paras and other international troops providing a ring of steel around the training camps in northern Iraq , the British instructors will seek to improve the skills of the locally raised forces so they can defeat IS in a so-called ` spring offensive ' pencilled in for April .  British and US commanders are hoping to raise a force of 20,000 Iraqis and Kurds to push back IS forces from strategically significant cities such as Mosul .  They will be backed by air strikes and also drone attacks , which are playing an increasingly critical role in the campaign .  The ramping up of Britain 's training mission in Iraq will be approved by the UK 's National Security Council next week and formally announced by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon in Parliament .  Defence sources confirmed last night that the British deployment to Iraq would include a ` force protection ' element with soldiers being sent there for up to six months .  But last night former British military intelligence officer Frank Ledwidge raised concerns that the increase in UK troops would inevitably lead to casualties .  Defence Secretary Michael Fallon will make the formal announcement in Parliament next week  Mr Ledwidge , who served in Iraq in 2004 , said : ` The British troops will have a big red flag on them and will be a big target for IS .  ` The threat is likely to come from car bombings and suicide attacks so the force protection element of the deployment will need to be proactive .  ` They wo n't just be guarding the perimeter of the camp , they 'll have to patrol and interact closely with local security forces . It will be a risky and complex job .  ` This is definitely `` mission creep '' and if or when UK casualties are taken next year I 'd expect to see the size of the British deployment to Iraq increase .  ` Post-Afghanistan the British Army is looking for a new role in order to maintain its sense of purpose and its troop numbers because the Ministry of Defence will not be protected from the sharp cuts in public spending that are on the horizon . So the generals will be thrilled by this deployment . '  The move to increase Britain 's commitment to the war against IS follows a review by UK military advisers . Their conclusions were sent to Mr Fallon .  The Government has insisted repeatedly that the training mission will not constitute ` boots on the ground ' and in accordance with this policy , the Paras ' role will be strictly defensive . Two months ago a team of 12 soldiers from the Yorkshire Regiment were sent to northern Iraq to teach the Peshmerga how to use heavy machine guns .  A UK advisory team is also based in the Iraqi capital Baghdad while , as The Mail on Sunday has exclusively revealed , British Special Forces have conducted a series of attacks against IS and are believed to have killed hundreds of jihadis .  Last week the US announced that it was committing 1,500 troops to training Iraqi forces while up to 400 Australian soldiers and 100 German personnel will also be involved .  These international troops will be confined to training bases but their mere presence will require security procedures to be stepped up .  A Ministry of Defence spokesman said last night : ` The Defence Secretary announced the intention to provide further training to the Iraqi military in early November .  ` No decision on troop numbers , units or locations have been made , so this is purely speculation at this stage . '    	  Paras ' job will be to protect 350 British instructors being sent in January    They will train up a force of 20,000 from Iraqi army and Kurdish peshmerga    Paras will be authorised to shoot and kill jihadis if they come under attack    Move due to be approved in UK 's National Security Council next week    Former intelligence officer warns increase in UK troops will lead to casualties	A force of up to 100 Paras is being sent to join the battle against Islamic State  IS  with authority to shoot and kill when needed .

245	By Sarah Harris  PUBLISHED :  18:10 EST , 29 January 2013   |  UPDATED :  03:20 EST , 30 January 2013  Warning : Headteacher Nicole Chapman says some parents praise their daughters too much  Parents are turning their daughters into ` little princesses ' who ca n't take criticism , the head teacher of a leading girls ' grammar school warned yesterday .  Nicole Chapman said some families treat daughters as if they ` can do no wrong ' and constantly shower them with praise and presents ,  As a result , many lack the ` resilience ' to deal with failure or criticism , she said .  Mrs Chapman , who is head of one of the best selective schools in the country , spoke out ahead of a conference at her school in Chelmsford , Essex - attended by parents and other school leaders - about educating teenage girls .  ` What I try to address with my parents here is the concept of what we call the little princess , which is one where a child , once she 's satisfied her parents ' ambitions to get into the school , she can do no wrong , ' she said ,  ` She 's constantly praised - and that is not necessarily a good thing . '  Mrs Chapman , who has a grown-up son , said that ` the little princess ' always wants to please and gets ` a lot of rewards ' for her troubles .  She said : ` For some of them it 's just praise , but with others they can have more or less what they want .  ` Their parents shower them with presents . '  She said some parents ` never exposed ' their daughters to any negative feedback .  This made girls into ` perfectionists ' who would not take risks in case they failed .  Instead of excessive praise , she said , parents should ensure their daughters were ` strong individuals ' who could cope with failure and grow up to be leaders .  ` Our girls are bright and therefore , they will be leaders , ' she said .  ` As a leader , you 're not a princess . As a leader , you 've got to have strength , belief , resilience .  ` You have to have the right principles - you must be principled , but you must have knowledge .  ` All those things do n't necessarily go with being a princess because a princess is a bit fragile .  ` A princess receives information , learns it , regurgitates it , but never gets truly challenged . '  ` Perfectionists ' : Mrs Chapman said some parents have ` never exposed ' their daughters to risk meaning they are afraid of failure  file photo   Mrs Chapman is head of the 900-pupil Chelmsford County High School for Girls , where 88 per cent of pupils pass their GCSEs with As or A * s last summer .  Her comments were echoed by Dr JoAnn Deak , author of Girls Will Be Girls : Raising Confident and Courageous Daughters .  Speaking at the conference yesterday , she said many parents ` tend to go overboard on praise ' , making girls ` feel precious ' and that they 're ` the centre of the universe ' .  Praise should be ` specific and earned ' instead , she said .  Referring to daughters , the American psychologist said : ` As a parent , you 'll obviously offer general praise to her sometimes , but if you do it too often , your opinion will not be valued .  ` Remember too , that the more she focuses on self , the more selfish she will become ; whereas the more she focuses on doing and on others , the more she will increase her self esteem . '  Conference : The comments by Mrs Chapman came ahead of a conference at her school in Chelmsford , Essex , about educating teenage girls  Earlier this month a leading psychologist warned that praising children with phrases such as ` well done darling ' could damage their confidence .  Stephen Grosz says ` empty praise ' such as ` you 're so clever ' or ` you 're such an artist ' could cause children to be unhappy as they feel they can not live up to the false expectations , and can even hinder their progress at school .  Mr Grosz - who has practised as a psychoanalyst , a type of psychologist , for 25 years - cites research showing that children who were heavily praised were likely to perform worse in maths problems and even tended to lie about their results .  Instead he advises parents and teachers to bestow compliments less frequently and use phrases that congratulate children for ` trying really hard ' .

247	Gallipoli is a burial ground . A terrible reminder of the violence of war .  It 's where men of all ages , neighbourhoods and nationalities were stripped down to their common human thread of flesh and blood and bone .  A remarkable set of circumstances we call The Lost Stories of Anzac , which airs on 60 Minutes , at 8.10 pm on the Nine Network tonight .  Scroll down for video  Richard Vines and Ashley Vines at Baby 700 . The hill which was known as Baby 700 , was one of the main Australian objectives at the dawn landing on 25 April 1915 , which included a wounded Ashley Vines Snr  They landed on the wrong beach at the wrong time . Liz Hayes joins relatives at Gallipoli to trace the steps of the unknown heroes among the ANZAC troops  Primary schoolmates Ashley Vines  left  and Allan Vowles  right  . Liz Hayes tells a remarkable story of circumstance which leads to the pair being reunited on the bloody battlefields of Gallipoli and how Allan would save Ashley 's life  I went there with a number of family members , all of whom were learning for the first time what had happened to their Gallipoli soldiers .  And I watched as they were confronted by the horror and the sadness , the brutality and the bravery that had occurred .  It was all felt deeply by 21-year-old Ashley Vines .

I could see that as he and his dad Richard walked the trenches and looked up at the cliffs from Anzac Cove ... Ashley suddenly understood what it must have been like .  Ashley Vines snr was in the second wave of Australians to hit the shore on April 25th , 1915 and even as he and his mates saw the diggers in front of them being mowed down ... they still ran forward .  Richard and Ashley Vines jnr at Gallipoli to retrace the steps of Ashley Vines snr , ' I could not even imagine getitng off a boat with all these other Australians and almost facing certain death '  Nearing the top of the cliffs , Ashley Vines was shot .  But in what was an extraordinary act of courage , he survived with the help of a schoolmate .  Allan Vowles had not seen his schoolmate since kindergarten , but out here in the battlefield now littered with bodies ... he recognised Ashley Vines and for the next five hours , dodging bullets , helped carry him back down to the beach to safety .  It is a story that strikes a very emotional chord .  Like all of us , 21-year-old Ashley Vines and his dad , Richard , are in awe of the friendship and bravery displayed that day .  But there is something else too ... the realisation that had Allan not saved their great grandfather and grandfather ... today neither of them would be standing at Gallipoli .  The very best and very worst took place at Gallipoli .  As I walked amongst the bodies now buried in cemetery after cemetery I could n't help but feel terribly sad .  ` Initially they thought , let 's stick together , why do n't we go in and form a public schools company and we 'll fight together ' . The historian tells the relatives of Ashley Vines snr how he came about to be fighting in Gallipoli with some of his closest mates  I understand why we cling to those stories of great Australian mateship and courage ; the humanity that still survived despite the horrors that engulfed them all ... because without them , I can only feel despair .

248	US President Barack Obama walks to 18th green as he plays golf at Mid-Pacific Country Club in Kailua , Hawaii , during his winter holiday in January  Barack Obama has reportedly already ` checked out ' of his job even though there are more than two years left until he leaves office in January 2017 .  The US President is said to have played 81 rounds of golf since re-election -- as many as he played in his entire first term -- and has holed himself up in Washington where he attends fundraisers and dinners with celebrities rather than tackling the day-to-day business of congressional politics .  He is already all but a lame duck due to deadlock on Capitol Hill and has been forced to use executive powers to enact reforms . But come the mid-term elections in November , he could lose power entirely if the Republicans take the Senate .  In the meantime , commentators claim he believes that his time in office is effectively over -- and has begun enjoying himself .  US reports say he has been house hunting and has looked at a # 2.5 million mansion in Rancho Mirage , California -- dubbed the ` playground of the presidents ' .  Mr Obama was also recently due to appear on a late night talk show hosted by comedian Jimmy Kimmel , but cancelled after being savaged by the US media and Republicans .  They claim that he has not responded strongly enough to the downing of Malaysian airlines flight MH17 and needs to take a tougher line with Russia .  On the day of the crash Mr Obama attended two fundraisers in Manhattan and went golfing three days later .  An analysis by the New York Post revealed that in the 628 days since re-election in 2012 , Mr Obama has already matched the 81 days he spent playing golf in his entire first term .  He has also attended 75 political fund raisers as the New York Times claimed that he prefers to host public figures at the White House late into the night rather than engage with the minutiae of politics on Capitol Hill .  A report in the newspaper this month said that on a trip to Italy earlier this year , the US Ambassador in Rome had to scramble together a host of intellectual figures at the last minute to attend a dinner party requested by the president .  Last week the Los Angeles Times gave a potential glimpse into Mr Obama 's life post-presidency with a report which claimed he and First Lady Michelle Obama had bought a home in Rancho Mirage in the California desert .  The property is in a gated community where entertainers Frank Sinatra , Bob Hope and Bing Crosby once maintained estates .  The four-bedroom custom-built home also has a rock lagoon , two spas and 3.2 acres of land .  A view of the home reportedly bought by the Obamas in Rancho Mirage in the California desert  Mr Obama has long faced criticism that he has not dirtied his hands with the day-to-day business of Congressional politics and that this has contributed to the rancour on Capitol Hill which nearly brought about a government shutdown last year .  If the Republicans did take the Senate they would redouble their attempts to repeal his health care reform , the President 's signature piece of domestic legislation .  Mr Obama will leave office in January 2017 and will be replaced by the winner of the 2016 Presidential election , which could be Hillary Clinton if she runs as the Democrat candidate .

249	Experts have abandoned an eight-day vigil for a wakeup call from the robot lander Philae , but remained hopeful the scout will revive as it rides on a comet nearing the Sun .  Monitoring for the lander , which has been hibernating since November , will resume next month , the mission said .  ` Perhaps it is still too cold for the Philae lander to wake up on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko , ' the German Aerospace Centre  DLR  said in a blog posted by the European Space Agency  ESA  .  ESA scientists have renewed efforts to contact the Philae lander on Comet 67p , shown in the illustration above  The Rosetta probe , which was carrying Philae , launched into space in 2004 , using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P .  It chased comet 67P/Churyumov -- Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years , and entered orbit in August 2014 .  After a four billion mile  6.5 billion km  journey , the probe then successfully released the Philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 November 2014 , travelling at 1 metre  40 inches  per second relative to the comet .  But when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet .  This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles  1km  above the comet before again landing on the surface . It then bounced again , but to a much lower altitude .  Scientists recently said that water on the comet was different to that on Earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid , not a comet .  ` Maybe its power resources are not yet sufficient to send a signal to the team at the DLR Lander Control Center . '  There has been no news of Philae for more than four months .  That was when the battery ran down on the 100-kilogram  220-pound  lab after it bumped down in a rugged , shadowed part of the comet .  Philae had just enough juice to carry out a 54-hour roster of core experiments before going into shutdown mode .  The hope is that as the comet races towards the Sun , more light will bathe the probe 's solar panels , enabling it to power up again and resume work .  Its mother ship Rosetta sent down Philae on November 12 after a 10-year trek around the Solar System .  It began to listen out for signals on March 12 as it launched a schedule of orbital swoops around the spot where Philae is believed to have landed .  But there was only silence , and at 0400 GMT on Friday , Rosetta 's communication unit was switched off , the ESA blog said .  ` It was a very early attempt , ' said DLR Project Manager Stephan Ulamec .  ` We will repeat this process until we receive a response from Philae . We have to be patient . '  Engineers saw an early chance in March when comet and lander were about 300 million kilometers  187 million miles  from the Sun , and the amount of solar radiation had nearly doubled compared to November .  The next chance to receive a signal is during the first half of April , the blog said .  Philae needs an internal temperature of more than minus 45 degrees Celsius  minus 49 degrees Fahrenheit  and at least five watts of power to automatically turn on .  Until it can generate 19 watts , it can not send signals to Earth via the orbiter .  Philae has 10 instruments , including a drill , chemistry sets and imaging tools .  It is the crowning feat in a 1.3-billion-euro  $ 1.4-billion  mission to unlock the secrets of comets , which some astrophysicists believe may have ` seeded ' Earth with some of the ingredients for life .  The Rosetta orbiter took a number of images of Philae as it bounced , with its final suspected resting place in the top right . However , further attempts to find the lander at the foot of the cliff have failed to find the probe  Philae touched down on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on 12 November , but rather than landing softly , the failure of its harpoons and thrusters saw it bounce twice .  It first bounced to a height of 0.62 miles  1km  and then 65ft  20 metres  before finally coming to rest at an angle on uneven ground .  Blurry images captured the the spacecraft movement through the air .  Scientists described the comet 's surface as being more like a trampoline , causing the probe to rebound so far .  It is thought the probe settled in a ditch beneath a cliff after bouncing more than half a mile from its original landing site .  The duck-shaped comet 67p/Churyumove-Geraismenko is moving closer to the sun and warming up as it does  This image sent back by the Philae lander shows one of its three feet next to what appears to be a cliff face  Scientist have been pouring over photographs of the landing area using the mothership Rosetta in an attempt to find the missing probe .  Philae was able to send back a photograph - the first taken from the surface of a comet - of an overhanging cliff face that is thought to be obscuring the lander .  Before its batteries finally ran out , Philae managed to send back data on the few experiments it was able to conduct along with some images .  Among the discoveries to have been released so far is that the comet 's surface appears to be made of a very hard ` sintered ' ice .  This graphic shows how Philae bounced twice after it failed to anchor itself to the surface of the comet  Researchers also revealed that they had found organic molecules - the basic building blocks of life .  From several miles above the comet , Rosetta has also continued to provide a constant stream of images and data since it arrived .  But there are some fears that dust thrown up by the landing and movement of the comet itself could have covered the lander 's solar panels .  This would mean it may struggle to get enough light to power its communication units and the experiments it is carrying on board .  The image above is a composite of four pictures taken by the Rosetta probe while flying 12 miles above the surface of the 2.4 mile wide comet 67p and shows the dramatic landscape that surrounds the Philea lander  Comet 67p is due to reach its closest point to the sun in August this year and this is when scientists believe they have the best chance of hearing back from the stricken lander .  Philae requires its internal temperature to reach at least -45 degrees C before it can wake up .  It will also require at least 5.5 watts from its solar panels to wake up .  Once awake , Philae will turn on its receiver every 30 minutes and listens for a signal from the Rosetta orbiter .  Koen Guerts , part of the Philae lander team at the DLR Control Centre , said the probe may have already woken up but is yet to send a signal home .  He said : ` Philae is designed so that , since November 2014 , it has been using all the available solar energy to heat up . '  ` At this time , we do not yet know that the lander is awake.To send us an answer , Philae must also turn its transmitter -- and that requires additional power . '  This blurry image captures the moment Philae bounced from the comet 's surface after failing to anchor itself  Rosetta captured a mothership 's view of Philae as it descended to the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on 12 November 2014 before losing contact with the probe after it bounced twice on the surface  Philae needs a total of 19 watts to begin operating and allow two-way communication .  Over the next eight days the Rosetta orbiter is due to transmit signals to its lander and listen for the response during a series of 11 flybys .  Engineers have also sent new commands to the lander to optimise the heating and provide energy savings to improve its chances of communication with Earth .  Once Philae wakes up and can also transmit , it will first send data about its ` health ' to Earth .  The scientific work with the 10 instruments on board Philae also depends on these results .  If sufficient energy can not be stored in the battery , the solar energy available during the comet daytime will determine whether a reduced version of the measurements can be performed .  Currently , scientists believe that Philae is in sunlight for 1.3 hours - just a fraction of the 12.4 hour long day that the comet enjoys .  Mr Ulamec added : ` Once we can communicate with Philae again , the scientific work can begin . '  	  European Space Agency has begun attempting to contact the lost probe    Philae has been missing since November when it landed on Comet 67p    Scientists believe the lander bounced into a ditch in the shade of a cliff    But they say it may already be awake but not yet able to send messages    The probe needs 19 Watts of power from its solar panels to communicate    As the comet gets closer to the sun the lander may receive more sunlight    Scientists have sent commands to Philae for it to begin warming itself up    They will attempt to contact the lander with Rosetta over the next 8 days	Experts have abandoned an eight-day vigil for a wakeup call from the robot lander Philae , but remained hopeful the scout will revive as it rides on a comet nearing the Sun .

250	Thousands of GCSE pupils had their English results downgraded only two weeks before they were due to be published , it emerged last night .  They went from a C to a D after a last-minute request from exam regulator Ofqual on August 7 to board Edexcel .  Ofqual had intervened just a fortnight before the publication of this summer 's results , to curtail grade inflation .  Scroll down for video  Thousands of GCSE pupils had their English results downgraded only two weeks before they were due to be published  Around 24,000 students sat the paper and it is estimated that between 15 to 20 per cent of those -- nearly 5,000 pupils -- were on the crucial C/D boundary and may have been affected by the belated decision to raise the standard required for a C grade .  The revelation will pile more pressure on Education Secretary Michael Gove -- accused of washing his hands of ` all responsibility ' in the grading row .  Meanwhile teachers called for Ofqual 's chief regulator , Glenys Stacey , who appears before the Commons education select committee today , to quit .  The English grading row erupted on August 23 , as furious teachers claimed thousands taking exams with various boards had unfairly missed out on Cs .  Ofqual had found that English GCSEs set in January -- taken by more than 58,000 pupils -- were ` graded generously ' .  Test : The revelation will pile more pressure on Education Secretary Michael Gove  Now letters between Ofqual and exam board Edexcel , seen by the Times Educational Supplement , reveal summer grading decisions were overruled at the 11th hour .  Ofqual 's director of standards , Dennis Opposs , wrote to Edexcel on August 7 , concerned that the board was about to award results for GCSE English that would see the proportion of pupils with grade Cs rise eight percentage points above the statistical prediction .  He called on the board to act ` quickly ' and ` produce outcomes that are much closer to the predictions ' . He said : ` This may require you to move grade boundary marks further than might normally be required . '  Edexcel replied the following day , stating that it had considered the issues raised by Ofqual but still felt its proposed grades were ` fair ' .  However , the letter added that if Ofqual still required a change , the board could move the minimum requirement for a C grade in one of the GCSE English units up to 65 marks out of 96 -- up ten from January 's 55-mark grade boundary .  In Ofqual 's August 9 reply , Mr Opposs stated that the board was obliged to ensure its results were consistent with others that were close enough to predictions .  The letter also suggested the 65-mark boundary would actually be tougher than required . But Edexcel 's website shows that , in the end , it was adopted .  Questions will now be raised about whether Ofqual also intervened with other boards ' results.The TES is publishing the full letters online today .

252	By Thomas Burrows  A grieving woman has been ordered by a church to remove the headstone from her partner 's grave - because it has kisses on it .  Janet Corless , 52 , was devastated when her partner of 30 years Mike Howsey died in January this year , aged 49 . He died from a pulmonary embolism caused by deep vein thrombosis .  To commemorate her partner , she spent # 2,000 on a loving tribute with an inscription containing two small kisses on the headstone and one on the base , as well as the phrase ` sleep tight Dad ' . The headstone was erected on May 2 .  Scroll down for video  Ms Corless , 52 ,  left  and daughter Sophie , 19 ,  right  are furious that St Mary 's Brownedge Church in Bamber Bridge , Lancashire , has ordered them to remove the headstone they erected to commemorate Mike Howsey , Ms Corless ' partner and Miss Howsey 's father  St Mary 's Brownedge Church in Bamber Bridge , Lancashire said the headstone was ` inappropriate ' because it contained kisses and the phrase ` sleep tight Dad '  Ms Corless said she was ` absolutely heartbroken ' by the decision by the church to remove the headstone , which she had erected on May 2 to commemorate her partner , Mike Howsey , who died in January this year  But Ms Corless and daughter Sophie , 19 , have had to remove the stone after the Roman Catholic church told them the inscription was ` inappropriate ' .  Ms Corless , a primary school supervisor from Walton-le-Dale in Lancashire , was disgusted by the decision , especially as she said other headstones in the churchyard had similar phrases and kisses .  She said : ` The priest took exception to the little kisses and the phrase `` sleep tight Dad '' .  ' I ca n't believe it . It 's so callous and I 'm absolutely heartbroken .  ` It 's only seven months since Mike died suddenly right in front of Sophie and me and it is still very raw .  ` The headstone we chose was beautiful and we were delighted with it when it was put on the grave .  Mike Howsey  pictured  died in January this year . His partner , Janet Corless , spent # 2,000 on a tribute but has been ordered to remove the headstone because it was deemed ` inappropriate '  ` But when they told us the inscription was inappropriate and would have to go it was a complete bombshell .  ' I had a meeting with the priest and pleaded with him to allow it but he seemed totally unsympathetic .  ` He said the kisses were n't acceptable on the headstone and neither was the phrase on the base .  ' I could n't believe it and I just stormed out . I was hysterical . '  She added : ` Mike meant the world to us . It 's hard enough coping with our loss without having something like this making it worse .  ` Why ca n't they show some compassion ? '  Ms Corless said her partner died suddenly after he became ill last Christmas .  ` Mike became really poorly the week after Christmas . He nearly passed out when walking upstairs and so he went to the doctors .  ` They thought he was badly anaemic and needed a blood transfusion so he had that on New Year 's Day .  ` He was sent home and a few days later he collapsed and died . It 's been an incredibly difficult time for us and me and my daughter worked hard to get the money together so we could get a special headstone .  ` We do n't have another # 2,000 to spend on another one but Cocker Memorials , who supplied the headstone , have been very kind to us and so hopefully we wo n't have to . ''  Ms Corless , a primary school supervisor from Walton-le-Dale in Lancashire , was disgusted by the decision by St Mary 's Brownedge Church in Bamber Bridge , Lancashire , to remove the headstone  Cocker Memorials , who are based in Preston , insisted the inscription was authorised before it was erected at St Mary 's Brownedge Church in Bamber Bridge , Lancashire .  Company director Michelle Howe , said she had received verbal approval from the church before the stone was erected .  ` Sometimes we get written confirmation and sometimes it 's done with a phone call .  ` This was over the phone .  ` We would n't have gone ahead and made the headstone if we did n't have approval .  ` But it now looks like we will have to make an entirely new one because covering up the letters wo n't look right . '  Miss Howsey , the daughter of Ms Corless and Mr Howsey , added : ` The priest said we could have `` sleep tight Dad '' , but on a separate piece of stone - not on the headstone .  ` So , really , it 's just down to those little kisses .  ` I 've been round the churchyard and there are other headstones with kisses on .  ` It seems ridiculous . '  A local parishioner at St Mary 's Brownedge Church said : ` The priest is straight down the line .  ` Personally , I do n't think there 's anything wrong with it but he 's a bit old school . '  Father George Corrie at St Mary 's said : ` We extend our deepest sympathies to Ms Corless at this difficult time and will be working closely with the stonemason to make sure her partner 's headstone is erected correctly as soon as possible .

253	Paul John Stamp was allegedly burned to death by Gary Stewart Miles and Gregory John Channing after a row over beer last year  A man is accused of burning his friend to death after the friend drank his last four cans of beer .  Gary Stewart Miles , 40 , is accused of murdering Paul John Stamp , 47 , in Darwin in September last year after a row .  According to news.com.au , Stamp , who was sharing a house with Miles at the time , apparently drank the last four cans of Miles ' beer , despite being warned not to .  When Miles found out , he and Gregory Channing allegedly beat Stamp , breaking eight ribs and causing internal injuries .  The duo are then accused of dragging him to the boot of a car before driving to an industrial estate where they planned to ` teach him a lesson ' by making him walk home .  Darwin Supreme Court heard that the car ran out of fuel , so the pair hitched a ride to get some more , and when they returned Miles poured the petrol over the car before setting it alight and burning Stamp to death .  Miles denies murder . Channing is already serving a five year sentence for assault on Stamp and deprivation of liberty .  Appearing in court , Channing told prosecutors that Miles had snapped , shouting ` I 'm going to kill this c *** ' while covering the car with fuel .  Miles was shocked by what he 'd done , Channing said , adding : ` You could tell by the way he was , he was a different person . Upset , like he could n't believe what happened , like it did n't happen but it did . '  But defence counsel Jon Tippett QC accused Channing of setting the car alight because he had n't liked Stamp , who had been disrespectful and commented on Channing 's girlfriend 's breasts .  ` You were the person who came up with the plan , were n't you , because this man Stamp really p ***** you off , ' Mr Tippett alleged . Channing agreed but denied starting the fire .  He previously told the court that Miles initiated the beating and paid for the fuel but under cross-examination said he had paid for it , as Miles did n't have his wallet .  The pair were arrested last year , two days after Stamp 's body was found in the burned out car .  The pair , who deny the murder , have appeared in Darwin Supreme Court . Channing is already serving five years after being found guilty of assault and depriving Mr Stamp of his liberty in December  Speaking to the Australian Times , Stamp 's brother Craig , said he had moved from Western Australia to the Northern Territory a week before while looking for a job in mining .  He said : ` It 's just insane . He just had a big heart and loved everyone . He always tried hard to please everyone . I spoke to him on Saturday , a mate had organised a job for him and found him an apartment .  ` It was a new opportunity for him . The last I heard from him was when he sent me a text on Tuesday for my son 's birthday , and then it happened that night . '  Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article .

254	` Staggering hypocrisy ' : Unite general secretary Len McCluskey , pictured , has condemned zero-hour contracts  Labour 's union paymasters faced accusations of hypocrisy last night after it was revealed that they use tutors employed on controversial ` zero-hours ' contracts .  Unite , Britain 's biggest trade union , has led a campaign against bosses who take on staff without guaranteeing how many hours they will work , or how much they will be paid .  General secretary ` Red ' Len McCluskey has claimed the ` pernicious practice ' is blighting Britain and ` the Government 's refusal to address the growing scandal is creating a growing sub-class of insecure and low-paid employment ' .  Labour leader Ed Miliband , whose party has received # 12 million in donations from the Left-wing organisation since the Election , has also claimed that workers on zero-hours contracts are being exploited .  But today it can be revealed that Unite 's own union reps are being taught by academics employed by further education colleges on zero-hours contracts .  A leaked report presented to bosses admits the practice is going on , and could be ` problematic ' given the union 's opposition to deals that are said to leave staff with little job security , no pension or holiday pay .  Last night Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps criticised the union over its ` staggering hypocrisy ' . He said : ` Len McCluskey spent the summer shamelessly grandstanding about zero-hours contracts , yet Unite reps are being trained in colleges using these contracts .  ` Rank-and-file union members will be appalled to discover their union not only teaches lessons in intimidation , but that Unite 's leadership preaches against the use of zero-hour contracts while using them . '  Tory party chairman Grant Shapps , pictured , criticised Mr McCluskey for spending the summer ` grandstanding '  The unpublished report , Education Inquiry For Unite , presented to its executive council earlier this year , describes how the union has tried to cut costs on courses and states : ` There were savings to be made when tutors who were only irregularly required were now on zero-hours contracts .  ` It was recognised that such changes had been challenging though , given trade union perspectives on zero-hours contracts more generally . '  Unite insisted it did not directly employ the tutors , who work for colleges and who give short courses to union reps in how to campaign more effectively . A spokesman said : ` Unite is not a zero-hours employer .  ` That view will have been made clear to the colleges , but we can not be answerable for their employment practices .

256	A swimwear model has told how a DIY lip job ended in disaster when she tried to emulate the super pout of reality star Kylie Jenner .  The youngest reality star sister has sparked a huge craze for lip fillers , despite insisting that her full lips are natural .  But unable to afford # 200 injectable chemical fillers , part-time swimwear model and retail worker Gail Scott , from Salisbury in Wiltshire , was intrigued when she heard about a DIY version .  Gail Scott was desperate to emulate Kylie Jenner 's famous pout but did n't want to spend any money so sucked on a hairspray lid and was left with painful bruising above and below her lips  Gail had heard about a tool available online , which promises an enhanced look without injections .  Buyers suck into a lip shaped vessel to increase blood supply to the lips , temporarily giving an artificial plumped look .  Instead of spending # 30 on the product , she used the lid of a mini hairspray bottle instead . After placing it over her lips , she sucked for five minutes until her lips started to tingle .  Initially she was delighted when she removed the lid to see her lips looked fuller . But minutes later she was left with painful bruising around her mouth that has left her unable to model since and now she wants to issue a warning against the craze currently sweeping social media .

Apart from the pain , the dark bruising above my mouth looks like a moustache .  ' I feel ridiculous and I have n't wanted to leave the house since . I thought I was saving money but it 's cost me a fortune in make-up trying to cover it up .  ` My lips looked great after - but only for about three minutes until the bruising started and then my lips went down anyway .  ' I want other women to know the dangers , it 's not worth it . I was lucky not to burst a blood vessel because since I posted my warning I 've heard that can happen .

Gail explains : ` I know a lot of girls who have had it done because they like the way her lips look . It 's never been so popular . '  So keen to keep up with her peers , Gail planned to have the procedure , too .  She explains : ` It was n't that I was unhappy with my lips , I 've never had an issue with them , but I liked the way enhanced lips look , especially around the cupids bow . '  But at # 200 a time she was struggling to save the cash . She said : ` I wanted it done earlier this year but I 've been saving for a holiday and then my laptop broke so when heard about a cheaper way I decided to try it . '  Gail is warning other women who may have heard about DIY lip jobs to steer well clear after her botched attempt that left her in serious pain  However , her thrifty attempt has left her worse off than she was before and she 's turned to make-up to try and cover the bruising and says she wo n't be able to model again until it 's healed completely .  ' I thought I 'd saved money but it 's probably cost me that in foundation trying to cover it , ' she added .  Gail posted a warning on her own Facebook page at the weekend and says she has since been thanked by other women who were planning to perform DIY lip jobs .  She said : ` I have been lucky .

258	By Deni Kirkova  PUBLISHED :  08:51 EST , 23 September 2013   |  UPDATED :  03:46 EST , 24 September 2013  A woman was faced with a 50/50 chance of survival after doctors failed to spot her rare heart condition on two separate occasions .  Hollie Sassienie and filmmaker husband Darren , from London , were expecting their first child after 10 years together . It should have been the happiest time of their lives .  ` We were really excited . Our baby was planned , we were delighted and our families were over the moon for us , ' says Hollie , an entrepreneur and conference organiser for the Economist , now 32 .  Hollie Sassienie and filmmaker husband Darren , from London , were expecting their first child after 10 years together  ` We busied ourselves with work , by that time we worked for ourselves from home , planning out the nursery and thinking of names .  ` Just before I fell pregnant , I 'd been to the doctor as I 'd been feeling really quite breathless and was worried that I could never seem to quite catch my breath , but the doctor told me it was anxiety and not to worry . '  All Hollie 's scans progressed normally and the first half of her pregnancy went without any major problems .  But one day , when she was in her 21st week of pregnancy , Hollie suddenly fainted at home .  Concerned , she saw her GP who ran a series of tests . Nothing came up as abnormal and she was told to go home and rest .  At 29 weeks Hollie passed out six times and had a fit . She went to hospital but was told to go home  By 24 weeks Hollie was extremely breathless .  ' I could n't make it up the stairs without having to sit down half way to try and catch my breath , ' she says .  ' I could n't even make it to the toilet in the night without gasping for air . It was really quite scary , but everyone reassured me it was simply the growing baby taking up space and pressing under my ribcage that was making me lose my breath .  ` I 'm asthmatic anyway so thought that it could have been that having an effect too .  ' I saw other mothers in the second trimester looking and feeling great , with bags of energy - not me . I spent more and more time resting . I could n't walk our dog . It was all I could do to make it out of bed . '  At 29 weeks Hollie took a turn for the worse .  Over the course of a weekend she passed out six times . and at 5am one Sunday morning she started fitting after trying to make it from the bathroom back to bed .  Darren , woken by the noise , rang for an ambulance immediately . Paramedics quickly arrived , checked Hollie over and took her to the local hospital where she was declared well enough to go home and rest .  The following day while in bed , Hollie passed out again , vomited and suffered diarrhoea . Admitted to Watford General for a second time , her obstetrician recommended a cardiologist run an echo and ultrasound on her heart to rule out any complications .  Hollie was advised that the 29-week-old baby she was carrying would in all likelihood be delivered in 48 hours  The news was bleak .  Hollie had pulmonary arterial hypertension , a condition that hardens the arteries from the lungs to the heart .  Women suffering it are advised not to fall pregnant as their mortality rate climbs to 50 per cent .  Hollie was advised that the 29-week-old baby she was carrying would in all likelihood be delivered by C-section in the next 48 hours to increase her own chances of survival .  First , she was rushed to a specialist unit at Hammersmith Hospital some 30 miles away .  ` It was scary but I do n't think I really realised the seriousness of the condition , ' says Hollie .  ` It was n't until I opened my eyes at about 2am in the morning and found my parents , siblings and husband sat round my bed , all with ashen faces , that it started to sink in just how critical my condition was .  Hollie responded really well to the infusion of drugs to the heart , so was able to give birth at 34 weeks  ` When the care team explained that I needed to get all my affairs in place as I might not get through the delivery , it really hit home just how ill I actually was .  ` Luckily I responded really well to the infusion of drugs they were pumping straight into my heart to reduce its size and give me the best chance of survival . I was still very breathless , but the signs were improving . '  Baby Gabriella was eventually delivered by C-section at 34 weeks , weighing 5lb 2oz .  Gabriella , now 14 months old , was taken to the hospital next door , Queen Charlotte 's , while Hollie was rushed back to intensive care where she spent the next 10 days .  Hollie takes strong medication every day and it 's likely she will require a heart and lung transplant in the future  Two women with the same condition had previously died on day five and seven after being diagnosed , but Hollie pulled through that critical period and was allowed home a week later .  ` Knowing Gabriella was already home and waiting for me really spurred me on to get better .  ' I had to learn to walk again and still had a cocktail of drugs being injected straight into my heart every day , but that feeling of being home is the best ever .  Gabriella , now 14 months old , was delivered by C-section at 34 weeks , weighing 5lb 2oz  ` My husband Darren was the only one who really knew how scared I was during that whole time . He was brilliant and could n't have been more positive .  ` He was talking to specialists and sufferers all over the world to ensure we were armed with all the information we needed .  ` His support and the love and care of my family , combined with wanting to meet my baby , gave me the strength I needed to get through that incredibly difficult time . '  Hollie takes strong medication every day and it 's likely will require a heart and lung transplant in the future .  Housebound for the first 10 months after diagnosis , she came up with the idea of Sassy Bloom , a monthly gift box for new mums containing unique , practical and beautiful gifts for mum and baby .  ' I am hoping the business will do well so we can give something back and help further the research , ' she says .  Hollie 's life expectancy has increased from 3-5 years to 10 years and more , and recently she was delighted to meet a mother who had lived with the condition for over 20 years .  ` Today is a beautiful day . I am well , I have a wonderful daughter , amazing husband and fabulous family and a new business that I manage from home , ' says Hollie .

259	The number of women in work is rising faster in the UK than in any of the world 's most advanced economies , official figures show .  Female employment grew by 1.79 per cent in the past year -- the sharpest growth among the G7 group of leading nations . France and the US saw rises of 1.46 per cent , while employment among women grew by less than one per cent in Germany . In Japan , growth was only 0.34 per cent .  The figures were revealed by the Department for Work and Pensions  DWP  , which said that the number of women in work is more than 750,000 higher than four years ago .  Female employment grew by 1.79 per cent in the past year -- the sharpest growth among the G7 group of leading nations  file image   More than a third of the jobs created for women in the past year were part-time .  Employment minister Esther McVey said the rapid rise was partly because working mothers in the UK were increasingly able to find more flexible work .  ` Women across Britain can be proud of the path they 've blazed for future generations , ' she said .  ` Women can and should be able to make the choices that are right for them , and our reforms are designed to reflect that and allow women of all ages to pursue their career aspirations whatever their personal circumstances .  ` The flexibility of the jobs market in this country means women are able to do just that , and whether it 's self-employment , part time work , or board-level professionals -- the opportunities are there .  ` We have also reformed child care , giving more mums the option of moving back into the workplace if that 's what they want . '  The figures were collated using figures from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Office for National Statistics  ONS  .  Employment minister Esther McVey said the rapid rise was partly because working mothers in the UK were increasingly able to find more flexible work  The rise in female employment has gone hand in hand with a boost in the number of the self-employed , which Miss McVey said was a sign of women 's entrepreneurial spirit .  The DWP said female self-employment had been rising since the early 2000s and was fairly resilient to the recession .  The number of self-employed women is up by 188,000 compared to last year .  According to ONS data , the number of women working full-time increased by 223,000 to reach 8.13 million between April 2013 and 2014 , while the number of women working part-time increased by 132,000 to reach 6.09 million .  But while employment has risen , women 's wages still lag significantly behind men .

261	She is one of the hottest stars in Bollywood , currently seen shaking her sari next to a muscle-bound hunchback in the most expensive and ambitious film ever to come out of India .  She receives thousands of letters , most declaring undying love , many asking for her hand in marriage . She has a chauffeur , a make-up team and stylist , a cleaner , a cook and a personal assistant .  It is all the more surprising , then , that Amy Jackson , who was 23 yesterday , is a white girl from Liverpool with a girly Scouse accent more reminiscent of a cutesy five-year-old than a silver-screen sex siren .  Her extraordinary story has taken her from the quiet suburban streets of Walton in Liverpool to a jet-set life which means she is mobbed if she sets foot outside her limousine in Mumbai , Calcutta or Madras .  Scroll down for video  Superstar : Amy Jackson  pictured  now has a chauffeur , a make-up team and stylist , a cleaner , a cook and a personal assistant  Origins : Amy Jackson  pictured at the Miss England final  has gone from humble beginnings in Walton , Liverpool to starring in blockbuster Bollywood films  Her new film , called I , is even pulling in crowds here in Britain where she is largely unknown .  Yet she freely admits that her film career is a matter of pure chance : she had done no acting at all before her 2010 debut and could n't speak a word of Hindi .  That did n't seem to bother leading ` Kollywood ' director A. L. Vijay , who happened upon Amy 's modelling picture after she won the Miss Teen World beauty contest at the age of 17 in 2009 . They met in London two months later and he offered her the lead role in his 2010 movie Madrasapattinam .  ` I 'd never acted in my life , ' she says . ` A. L. Vijay asked if I could dance and I just said yes . I did n't tell him the only dancing I had done was on nights out in Liverpool . He said he would arrange workshops and help me with the scripts and the language . He liked the fact that I was English but had an Indian look . '  So , just before she turned 18 , Amy and her mother , Marguerita , a horse-riding instructor , found themselves in India meeting other actors and trying on costumes . Amy recalls : ` I 'd never been to India or anywhere like it .  ` There were cows wandering through the city . In the car on the way to the hotel I noticed Mum was grabbing on to the sides as we went in and out of traffic with the horn beeping . At one point a cow crossed the road in front of us and she screamed . '  Then she had to get used to the food . ` At the start I could n't eat anything . I did n't like the spice . I loved having Indian take-aways on a Friday night in Liverpool but it 's so different in the real India . '  While her friends spent their Saturdays getting ` curly blow drys ' at the local hairdresser before hitting the town , Amy was working 20-hour days in Madras , trying to learn the language .  Rise to stardom : Amy  left  freely admits her fame is a result of pure chance and she had never acted before her screen debut in 2010  Big hit : Her new film ` I ' is even attracted crowds in UK where she is a relative unknown as an actress  ` When my friends phoned before going out , I 'd be sat in my caravan on set with Mum learning Tamil , ' she says .  ` We had a TV but it just played Indian shows so we did n't watch it . I was so jealous and homesick . ' That all changed when Madrasapattinam became the biggest movie hit of 2010 .  It turned Amy into an overnight star and the offers of more roles flooded in . This year alone she will star in no fewer than four Indian movies -- and she has turned down nine other offers .  Amy was so much in demand that she did n't even have to audition for the part of Diya in the much anticipated I .  But it has n't all been plain sailing for Amy who has experienced racist abuse from a minority unhappy with her being cast as an Indian woman .  On social media and website forums , they demanded to know what this ` foreigner ' , this ` fake ' and ` fluke actress ' who ` ca n't even speak Hindi ' was doing in an Indian film .  ` Everyone has an opinion , ' she says warily . ` For me , as an actress you are playing a character and to play that character you have to get into that mindset . I do n't think it 's any disrespect to any race . If people enjoy your movies that 's the most important thing . '  I is Amy 's fifth Indian movie and is directed by Shankar Shanmugham , the country 's answer to Steven Spielberg . Loaded with special effects , it took her three years to make -- and takes audiences three hours to watch .  It tells the story of a top model  Amy  who enlists the help of a local body builder  Chiyaan Vikram  . The pair fall in love before he is deliberately infected with a hideous virus and turns into a gruesome hunchback . He then seeks revenge on the people who ruined his life .  Her south Indian voice was dubbed on to the pictures , but she did learn her lines in Tamil , an official language of India , so that her lips would be in sync .  She says the director wanted to make her look very Indian . ` Even my mannerisms had to change . I was very soft and gentle , and a typical south Indian lady . I wore brown contact lenses , which is crazy because all the big Bollywood stars wear green ones . '  Amy now splits her time between her sister 's home in London and her two-bedroom , apartment overlooking the Arabian Sea in Bandra , Mumbai . Because of the crowds she attracts , she is flanked by two burly bodyguards , Adrian and Max , wherever she goes in India .  She has one male assistant  ` he wakes me up in the mornings and makes all my juices for me '  , two hair and make-up people , one stylist , a driver and a housekeeper  ` she helps with the cooking and cleans but Mum does n't like it . One time I walked in and they were both cleaning the floor together '  .  She insists she loves her ` gipsy ' life but does admit that being able to pop to the shops to buy a pint of milk or walk to the postbox to send a letter when she is in the UK is a novelty .  ' I do n't really do any of that over there , ' Amy says describing how she draws a crowd from the moment she steps off the plane when she returns to Mumbai .  ` It 's like two different worlds .

262	Happy New Year !  The festive season is sadly over and it 's back to work and reality for most of us now .  All that eating , drinking and partying during Christmas and New Year can really take its toll on the complexion , so I 've decided a January skin-detox is due . Out with the old products , and in with the new .  Scroll down for video  Binky 's New Year 's beauty resolution is to detox her skin and regain a healthy complexion  It 's always a good idea to switch up your skincare routine every so often to correlate with your skin 's needs for the season , so this week I thought I 'd share with you some of the products I 'm using to revive my dull , tired post-Christmas complexion .  Unless you 've been living under a rock for the past few weeks , you 'll have heard that the French Pharmacy classic La Roche-Posay Serozinc is now available to buy in the UK -- exclusively at Escentual.com -- and this little gem has completely transformed my skin .  Serozinc is a zinc-sulphate enriched toning mist that has been applauded by bloggers , beauty writers and dermatologists around the world , and until a few days ago you 'd have to venture across the pond to get hold of it -- so you can imagine how excited I was when I heard I was finally going to be able to try it !  The toner only has three ingredients -- zinc sulphate , sodium chloride and thermal spring water . The simple yet highly effective formulation targets spots and blemishes , calming redness and with continued use leaving the skin looking and feeling clean and fresh . It 's hypoallergenic and non-perfumed too , making it suitable for acne-prone skin .  As part of her skin revamp Binky had a Skinbreeze Hydro Mask , the gel mask has powerful antioxidants that reduce redness and smooth fine lines and wrinkles  It also mattifies oily skin and prevents shine , as well as tightening the appearance of pores for an altogether more radiant and clear complexion .  Serozinc can be used as a daily toner between cleansing and moisturising , as well as during the day whenever your skin needs refreshing .  I 've been using it morning and night as part of my skincare routine for a few weeks now and the amount of angry red marks or blemishes popping up on my skin has drastically reduced -- my complexion feels clear , clean and fresh . Serozinc is selling fast , though , so make sure you get your mitts on it while you still can !  Binky also tried out Masque Bar Brightening Sheet Mask said to give you a radiant glow in just one use  I 'm sure most of us have suffered from pesky post-Christmas breakouts -- myself included -- so to restore and clarify over-worked skin I recommend the Vichy Normaderm 3 in 1 Cleanser , Scrub and Mask , which clears imperfections and eliminates excess sebum .  As it 's both a cleanser and an exfoliator , it also leaves the complexion looking brighter and more radiant , making it the ideal remedy to dull winter skin .  The moisturiser you pick is very much dependent on your skin type -- if you have oily skin , the La Roche-Posay Effaclar Mat Moisturiser will reduce shine and tighten pores , while keeping your complexion feeling super-soft .  For dry skin types , the Vichy Nutrologie 1 For Dry Skin Moisturiser rehydrates the skin by replenishing its natural supply of lipids -- leaving skin feeling smooth and nourished for 24 hours .  Another product to brighten up partied-out skin is the La Roche-Posay Pigmentclar Serum . It immediately minimises the appearance of dark spots and dull areas on the skin , evening out skin tone for a radiant and more uniform complexion .  Serozinc is said to be the hottest new beauty ingredient used by bloggers , beauty writers and dermatologists  January is a month for R&R , and for me there 's nothing more relaxing than chilling out with a face mask to refresh and rejuvenate dull , tired skin .  One of my ultimate favourites is the Skinbreeze Hydro Mask . It 's a gel mask filled with powerful antioxidants which immediately reduce the appearance of redness and irritation on the skin , as well as smoothing out fine lines and wrinkles .  The Hydro Mask -- like the name suggests -- always leaves my complexion feeling ultra-hydrated , making it the perfect January pick-me-up for the skin .  Another face mask I 'm loving is the Masque Bar Brightening Sheet Mask . It helps minimise the appearance of dark spots and pigmentation on the skin for a more even complexion , and transforms skin from dull and sallow to radiant and glowing after just one use .  Finally , if overindulging at Christmas has led to any pesky spots or blemishes cropping up , the REN ClearCalm 3 Clarity Restoring Mask will help calm them down and restore clarity to your skin . Its mix of antibacterial nutrients also reduce excess oiliness and minimise scarring , leaving skin feeling and looking purified .  2015 , I 'm ready for you  well , at least my skin is !  .

263	Free range chickens may not live the comfortable lives we have been led to believe , according to a leading British vet .  Research shows that chickens which are allowed to roam free are in fact more likely to catch disease , get injured and die earlier than those kept in cages .  Eggs from free range hens now make up 45 per cent of the British market -- a huge increase from just 1 per cent in 1980 .  Cluck happy ... or not : Chickens allowed to roam free in open fields in fact die sooner and are much more likely to catch diseases  Supermarkets and celebrity chefs would have us believe that free range chickens are happier , healthier and live more natural lives than those in battery farms .  But chickens allowed to roam free in open fields in fact die sooner and are much more likely to catch diseases , according to Barry Thorp of the Royal School of Veterinary Studies in Edinburgh .  They are also more likely to break their bones because they have not been bred to survive an outdoor life , he said .  Recent regulations mean that chicken houses are no longer the tiny squalid cages they once were .  Dr Thorp , speaking during a debate on chicken welfare at the British Science Festival in Birmingham yesterday , said : ` I think that for long-term sustainability , free range systems do not work .  ` I 'm certainly very comfortable with buying eggs from furnished cages . I have no issues with that at all .  ` I think free range has some merits but it also has many problems as well . I do n't see it having a long-term sustainability and that worries me . '  Ten per cent of ducks carry bird flu , posing a huge threat to chickens that is very hard to control  Dr Thorp said the boom in free range has been driven by the idea that chickens live better lives -- a message that has been amplified by large retailers .  ` Supermarkets love free range because they can make a bigger margin , ' he said .  But chickens kept in large fields are far more likely to pass diseases to each other and on to wild birds and ducks .  He warned that the increase in the number of free-range chickens raises the risk of a major epidemic of bird flu .  ` We have been lucky in this country that we have n't had a major bird flu outbreak , ' he said .  Dr Thorp , a specialised poultry vet , added : ` Having a physical barrier between chickens works -- cages stop disease because if nothing goes between A and B , disease does not travel between A and B.  ` When different chickens and wild birds come into contact with each other and their droppings , disease spreads .  ` As a vet I make far more money from farmers who have got birds kept free range than those kept in cages . '  The spread of disease between chickens in fields and ducks in nearby rivers is a particular risk , he said .  Ten per cent of ducks carry bird flu , posing a huge threat to chickens that is very hard to control .  Germany and Holland have been very wary of free range systems because of the bird flu risk , instead opting for barn rearing models in which chickens are easier to control .  Germany and Holland have been very wary of free range systems because of the bird flu risk , instead opting for barn rearing models in which chickens are easier to control  Dr Victoria Sandilands , of Scotland 's Rural College , said free range birds have a mortality rate of 8 to 10 per cent , far higher than caged hens ' death rate of 2 to 4 per cent .  Free range hens are also twice as likely to have fractured bones as those kept in cages .  Cages are also far better than they used to be , she said .  She added : ` Ten years ago cages used to have a wire floor with access to food and water but nothing else .  ` From 2012 only furnished or enriched cages have been permitted across the EU . '  Cages now have to contain nesting areas , separated from the rest of the cage , with a ` scratch floor ' , a perching area for every hen and more than seven square metres per chicken .  She told the Birmingham audience : ` Furnished cages provide a safe , clean environment , and laying hens are generally physically healthy . The ability to perform many natural behaviours has also improved greatly . '  Mia Fernyhough , senior scientific officer at the RSPCA , admitted that free range farming systems are far from ideal .  ` Free range is more complex so it takes more careful management to do it well , ' she said .  ` There is increased risk of mortality and increased risk of disease and injury .  ` But it can be managed well . Free range has a much , much greater potential for higher welfare .

265	There has been a lot of woeful decisions in the Premier League in recent weeks .  But the decision to rule out Jan Vertonghen 's second goal at White Hart Lane surely tops the lot when it comes to embarrassing the art of officiating .

Sunderland were on the attack with goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon nowhere to be seen when the ball broke to the defender who galloped clear from his own half before coolly slotting home .  The linesman tells referee Chris Foy that Vertonghen 's goal should be ruled out for offside  Vertonghen 's celebrations are short lived as officials rule out the Belgian defenders second goal  Video highlights later showed the linesman telling the referee in his ear piece that there was only one player covering , therefore the player was offside .  But that ruling would only come into play if the defender was in the oppositions half when he was played the ball , with replays showing he was five-yards or so in his own half .

267	Glenn Mason was jailed for 15 months today after the Old Bailey heard he stole # 185,000 from the accounts of elderly Natwest customers to fund his online gambling addiction  A respected NatWest bank manager who stole # 185,000 from his elderly customers to fund his internet gambling addiction sobbed as he was jailed for 15 months .  Glenn Mason , 56 , plundered the accounts of nine pensioners including an 83 year-old woman and a 92 year-old man who banked at his branch in Biggin Hill , Kent .  Mason , who was given an award by the Metropolitan Police in Bromley in 2009 for his crime fighting efforts , got away with the thefts for almost a year before his arrest in July 2012 .  His attempts to cover up his crime by transferring money using the identity of two of his colleagues , Julie Jeffrey , 50 , and James Cato , 35 , led to them being sacked and charged with fraud .  It was only when Mason pleaded guilty in September that the case against them was dropped at the Old Bailey .  Andrew Lawson , representing Mason , told the court that Mason turned to gambling after his teenage son was injured by a roadside bomb while fighting with British troops in Afghanistan .  Mr Lawson said that all of the stolen money was paid into his gambling account and told the court : ` It was late night poker and online games that are designed to tempt you into spending money in the hope of a big win . '  The court also heard statements from two of Mason 's victims , Julie Amos and Leslie Pilditch , who both said they no longer felt able to trust banks .  Julie Jeffrey , one of the workers implicated in the crime by Mason , described how she lost her job after her arrest and added : ` I no longer feel proud , my life has fallen apart . '  Elaine May , the current manager of the NatWest Biggin Hill branch , also said in a statement that the thefts had ` an ongoing impact within the community ' and put a strain upon the staff .  Mason continues to live in the area with his wife and son and has been working in a local newsagents .  The judge , Mr Recorder Simon Farrell QC , told him : ` You stole roughly # 185,000 over a period of a year from nine victims who were all elderly and undoubtedly vulnerable .  ` Your fellow worker Julie Jeffrey , who was falsely arrested because you used her ID details to steal the money , described how , having worked for NatWest since the age of 16 , losing her job as a 50 year-old woman and being reduced to delivery leaflets in all weathers .  ` Plainly these are very serious offences which everyone agrees cross the custody threshold . You are of previous good character and someone who has suffered considerable personal tragedy .  ` Your wife suffered from cancer in 2005 and your son at only 19 went to Afghanistan to fight for his country and was the victim of an improvised explosive device that caused him very serious injury .  The court heard Mason 's actions , which took place at Natwest in Biggin Hill  pictured  , caused elderly customers to lose their faith in banks  The judge added : ` I accept this caused you to develop a serious gambling addiction which was in fact the root cause of stealing the money from customers .  ` In my judgement I am afraid these matters are so serious that I am not able to suspend the sentence . The best I can do is to pass a sentence of 15 months imprisonment . But for your personal mitigation this sentence would have been far longer . '  Mason , of Biggin Hill , pleaded guilty to a single charge of fraud .

268	Double amputee smashed his personal best to qualify for London 2011  Oscar Pistorius had his legs amputated when he was 11 months old  Now runs on carbon-fibre prosthetic running blades  By Daily Mail Reporter  UPDATED :  05:31 EST , 21 July 2011  After a long battle to compete with able-bodied athletes , South African double amputee Oscar Pistorius has qualified for the 2012 London Olympics and next month 's world championships by smashing his 400m personal best .  Pistorious , known as ` Blade Runner ' because he runs on carbon fibre prosthetic running blades , recorded a new personal best of 45.07 seconds for the 400m race in Lignano , Italy yesterday.Pistorius , 24 , who had both legs amputated when he was just 11-months-old because of a congenital disorder , said : ` It was like a dream race .  Chasing his dream : Oscar Pistorius races to his personal best of 45.07 seconds in Lignano , Italy  Going to Olympics : The South African , seen after his wining race , has now qualified to compete with able-bodied athletes  ' I just have not been able to sleep . I must have 300 messages congratulating me .  ' I am sure tomorrow when I wake up it  the accomplishment  is going to hit me . It is really humbling to know I have gotten so much support from everyone . '  The winning performance means Pistorius has made history to become the first amputee sprinter to qualify for the world championships , which begin on August 27 in Daegu , South Korea .  A multiple Paralympic gold medalist , the South African had sought for years to compete in the world championships and Olympics .  Speeding ahead : After a long battle , Oscar Pistorius has been allowed to compete with able-bodied athletes and has now qualified for next month 's world championships  Oscar Pistorius was born with congenital absence of the fibula in both legs .  When he was 11 months old , his legs were amputated halfway between his knees and ankles .  Congenital absence of the fibula is a congenital disorder where in one or both legs there is a fibrous band instead of the fibula .  The result tends to be a short deformed leg , an absence of part of the ankle joint , and what is left is unstable and the foot has a deformity , or an absence of part of the foot .  Sometimes the foot can be brought into normal function ; sometimes it must be amputated .  Pistorius 's new time would have earned him fifth place in the men 's 400m final in the 2008 Olympics and the runner was overwhelmed at his achievement .  ` With 180 metres out , I just decided to set out for the end , and I really ran a very comfortable last 100 metres , ' he said .  ` It is kind of strange because I broke my personal best by half a second , which is ridiculous . '  Pistorius was born with a congenital absence of the fibula - the calf bone .  The Court of Arbitration for Sport gave him a chance to compete with able-bodied athletes in May 2008 , when it ruled in his favour after a long legal battle with the International Association of Athletics Federations over the use of his running blades , which the IAAF said gave him an unfair advantage .  In January 2008 the IAAF claimed that Pistorious 's blades required him to use 25 per cent less energy than his rivals to run at the same speed .  But the determined athlete argued that he was running at a disadvantage , with less blood in his body and no calf muscles , and Cas ruled he could compete with his blades .  But after the CAS decision , he failed to record a time inside the Olympic qualifying mark and missed the Beijing Games , although he won the 100m , 200m and 400m at the Beijing Paralympics .  The CAS stressed that any advancements in the prosthetic-limb technology used by Pistorius could be contested by the IAAF again .

269	Robin Van Persie has given Louis Van Gaal cause for concern after going off with a grimace at half-time of Netherlands ' friendly with Wales in Amsterdam .  Early suggestions were that the Manchester United striker had picked up a slight groin injury but whatever the extent it is a worry for the Dutch manager so close to the World Cup starting .  Van Gaal spoke before this game about Van Persie 's fitness and stated he was ` not 100 per cent ' after missing six weeks towards the end of last season through a knee injury .  Decisive : Arjen Robben scored one and made one for Holland in their win against Wales  Number one : Robben celebrates after giving Holland a first-half lead against Wales in Amsterdam  Positive : Lens showed that Holland do have some strength in reserve with a cool finish against Wales  Team player : Robben then takes the plaudits after setting up a goal for substitute Jeremain Lens  Any further troubles will throw Van Gaal 's plans for Holland 's opening group game against Spain on June 13 into doubt .

Arjen Robben had scored the opener in the first half by converting a rebound from a Van Persie shot .  Wales manager Chris Coleman will be warmed by the way his team , without Gareth Bale , Aaron Ramsey and Ashley Williams , tested the hosts at times and could have given their travelling something to cheer had a couple of openings been finished more accurately .  Much was made in the build-up to this game of Van Gaal 's decision to switch to a 5-3-2 system from Holland 's usual 4-3-3 . He trialled it in their previous friendly against Ghana last Saturday prompting Bert van Marwijk , the man who led his nation to the World Cup final four years ago , to question the wisdom of changing tactics so close to the tournament starting .  There might be more sniping to come given Van Gaal sprung a surprise by opting for a 4-4-2 diamond formation here . More strings to the Oranje bow or too much tinkering ?  Wesley Sneijder operated at the front of a midfield four behind Van Persie and Robben and with that trio on song , as was the case from kick-off , their positioning should n't matter .  Say cheese : Louis van Gaal is grabbed for a selfie with a Holland fan before the game  Time 's up : Holland captain Robin van Persie was taken off at half-time  Assist : Van Persie 's first-half shot was parried into the path of Robben who opened the scoring  Impact : Jeremain Lens replaced Van Persie at half-time and scored Holland 's second goal  Within two minutes Daryl Janmaat dispossessed Neil Taylor and fed Robben who lashed over , then 60 seconds later Van Persie fashioned space and forced Wayne Hennessey into a good save .  In the ninth minute Robben fooled debutant James Chester with a run in behind to break the offside trap and when Stefan de Vrij 's lofted ball found him a goal looked certain . But the Bayern Munich player dragged his shot wide .  It was whirlwind stuff yet this Welsh side , even shorn of its stars , can play a bit and gradually the visitors found a foothold in the game .  Joe Allen , captaining his country for the first time , was breaking forward with the ball and executing sharp passes . Jonny Williams began finding joy on the right hand side .  Then in the 20th minute Taylor released striker Simon Church down the left flank and his cross would have led to a tap-in for Andy King had Bruno Martins Indi not stretched to nick clear . It was a spell that will encourage Coleman for forthcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers .  Van Gaal 's team came again though . Robben played a one-two with Sneijder then jinked past Danny Gabbidon only to continue tip-toeing too long so when he fired his shot Chester was able to clear off the line .  In the 32nd minute he did not wait to pull the trigger . Van Persie beat Chris Gunter on the left and cracked a shot that Hennessey could only divert into the path of Robben who struck instantly .  Van Persie could have made it two soon after but he sliced his effort just wide after being teed up by Daley Blind . It was to be the last act in his game , replaced at half-time by Lens with cameras picking up a wince that will make Dutch fans do just the same .  The Dynamo Kiev forward did add gloss to Holland 's win by slotting in at the far post after a perfect cross from Robben , released by Sneijder , but it is clear any absence of Van Persie will cast a huge shadow .  Bum note : Wales player Hal Robson-Kanu changes his shorts at pitchside during the game  Support : Kevin Strootman , who will miss the World Cup through injury , was in the crowd to cheer Holland on  Have a word : Van Gaal talks to his assistant Patrick Kluivert ahead of kick-off  Stellar : Holland named a strong side including Robben , Van Persie , Sneijder and De Jong  Man of the people : Star man Robben gives the match ball to a Dutch fan at the end of the game  Orange : Dutch fans turned out in support of Van Gaal 's team before they depart for Brazil  	  Arjen Robben scores one and makes one in Holland friendly win    Robin van Persie taken off at half-time giving Louis van Gaal concern    Wales weakened by omission of star duo Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey    Van Persie replaced by Jeremain Lens who scores Holland 's second goal	Robin Van Persie has given Louis Van Gaal cause for concern after going off with a grimace at half-time of Netherlands ' friendly with Wales in Amsterdam .

270	By Emma Innes and Mark Prigg  An asteroid nine times larger than the QE2 has sailed past the Earth - and is so big it even brought along its own moon .  The 1.7 mile long space rock will get no closer than 3.6 million miles , or 15 times the distance between the Earth and the moon .  Scientists have named the asteroid 1998 QE2 but the name has nothing to do with the transatlantic Cunard liner - it follows a code used for newly-discovered asteroids by the US Minor Planet Centre in Cambridge , Massachusetts .  Scroll down for video  The asteroid was captured as it sailed past the earth . It is so big it even dragged its own moon along  An artist 's impression of the QE2 asteroid that sailed past earth last night  Researchers were stunned to spot the smaller moon asteroid is circling the larger space rock , an unusual but not unheard of space phenomenon .  The main asteroid is believed to be about 1.7 miles long , or nine times the length of the Queen Elizabeth 2 .  It was discovered on August 19 , 1998 , by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Near Earth Asteroid Research  Linear  programme near Socorro , New Mexico .  The object made its closest approach to Earth at 9.59 pm last night .  The sequence of radar images of asteroid 1998 QE2 was obtained on the evening of May 29 , 2013 , by NASA scientists using the 230-foot  70-meter  Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone , when the asteroid was about 3.75 million miles  6 million kilometers  from Earth , which is 15.6 lunar distances .  The first radar images of asteroid 1998 QE2 were obtained when the asteroid was about 3.75 million miles  6 million kilometers  from Earth . The small white dot at lower right is the moon , or satellite , orbiting asteroid 1998 QE2  The main asteroid is believed to be about 1.7 miles long , or nine times the length of the Queen Elizabeth 2 and has a rotation period of less than four hours .  The preliminary estimate for the size of the asteroid 's satellite , or moon , is approximately 2,000 feet  600 meters  wide .  The radar imagery revealed that 1998 QE2 is a binary asteroid .  In the near-Earth population , about 16 percent of asteroids that are about 655 feet  200 meters  or larger are binary or triple systems .  Radar images suggest that the main body , or primary , is approximately 1.7 miles  2.7 kilometers  in diameter and has a rotation period of less than four hours .  Also revealed in the radar imagery of 1998 QE2 are several dark surface features that suggest large concavities .  The preliminary estimate for the size of the asteroid 's satellite , or moon , is approximately 2,000 feet  600 meters  wide .  The radar collage covers a little bit more than two hours .  As the asteroid moves close , scientists scanned it with radar using a 230ft wide dish telescope at the Goldstone Observatory in California 's Mojave Desert .  The resolution of these initial images of 1998 QE2 is approximately 250 feet  75 meters  per pixel . Resolution is expected to increase in the coming days as more data become available .  Between May 30 and June 9 , radar astronomers using NASA 's 230-foot-wide  70 meter  Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone , California , and the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico , will perform an extensive campaign of observations on asteroid 1998 QE2 .  The two telescopes have complementary imaging capabilities that enabled astronomers to learn as much as possible about the asteroid during its brief visit near Earth .  Even from a distance of nearly four million miles , the researchers wanted to study features on the asteroid as small as 12ft across .  Chief investigator Dr Lance Benner , from the American space agency Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California , said : ` It is tremendously exciting to see detailed images of this asteroid for the first time .  The giant space rock will get no closer than 3.6 million miles , or 15 times the distance between the Earth and the moon  ` With radar we can transform an object from a point of light into a small world with its own unique set of characteristics . '  White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a press briefing about the asteroid : ` scientists have concluded the asteroid ` poses no threat to planet Earth ' .  He then laughed and said : ` Never really thought I 'd be standing up here saying that , but I guess I am . '  The asteroid will not make a return trip to the Earth for at least another two centuries .  In 2016 Nasa will launch a robotic sample return mission to one of the most potentially hazardous known near-Earth objects  NEOs  , the asteroid  101955  Bennu .  The asteroid , which measures a third of a mile across , comes within 500,000 kilometres of the Earth every six years .

Their spacewalk was beamed live across Russia by state television  A ` beautiful ' moment : The pair took turns to hold the red-and-grey torch , which was tethered tightly to their bulky spacesuits  The moment , captured on high-tech video and photo equipment , was beamed live across Russia by state television .  Mr Kotov and Mr Ryazansky can be seen taking turns to hold the red-and-grey torch , which was tethered tightly to their bulky spacesuits .  Their conversation mainly consists of complicated space jargon - with Mr Kotov having previously warned that he did not intend to make a ` grand pronouncement ' similar to the one Neil Armstrong delivered when he took his first step on the Moon in 1969 .  Safety : The torch was required to remain unlit while inside the space station due to safety precautions . It was not able to emit flames in open space due to the lack of oxygen  Lift-off : A screen grab taken from a live feed provided by NASA which shows astronauts with the Olympic torch  However , Mr Sergei can be heard calling the historic moment ` beautiful ' .  Today was the first time the Olympic torch had been taken into open space - but it was not able to emit flames due to the lack of oxygen .  Space officials had also stressed that safety precautions meant it had to remain unlit while inside the space station .  Despite this , Russia had previously contemplated sending the actual flame up to the station by encasing it in a special lantern .  However , senior officials eventually decided that lighting a fire aboard a Soyuz rocket filled with tonnes of explosive fuel was not a wise choice .  A three-man crew took the Olympic symbol up to the space station on a rocket  On Thursday , a three-man crew took the Olympic symbol up to the space station on a Russian rocket in a $ 100billion project of 15 nations .  An onboard camera showed Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata pumping the air with his fist as the Soyuz rocket lifted off from the Russian-rented Baikonur Cosmodrome .  After a six-hour trip to the station , Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin crawled through a hatch and handed the unlit torch to his beaming countryman on board , Fyodor Yurchikhin .  Wakata , Tyurin and Mastracchio sat beneath a stuffed polar bear in a blue scarf , a mascot of the first Olympics Russia has hosted since the Soviet era .  The spacewalk is part of what will be the longest torch relay before a Winter Olympics that President Vladimir Putin hopes will improve burnish international image .

Inspired by the Firebird of Russian folklore , the metre-long , red-and-silver torch weighs almost 2 kilograms on Earth but it floated in zero gravity .  As part of its 40,000-mile relay , the torch has travelled to the North Pole on an atomic-powered ice breaker .  It still has to go to the peak of Europe 's highest mountain , Mount Elbrus , and the depths of Siberia 's Lake Baikal before reaching Sochi on the Black Sea for the start of the Games on February 7 .

The US government recently advised people going to the Games to leave their laptops and mobile phones at home over fears of spying , according to research by journalists Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan .  The SORM surveillance system will allow the body to listen in on all communications in and out of the Olympic venue at Sochi in February .  It will allow security services to bug the communications of anyone without having to show providers court orders allowing the eavesdropping , the analysts said .  The Olympic torch has gone on voyages aboard spacecraft twice before , in 1996 and 2000 , but it has never been taken into open space  Russia has pulled out all the stops to get the subtropic region ready for the Games , spending more than $ 50 billion  37 billion euros  in state and corporate money on infrastructure improvements .  International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach insists the Olympic Charter will be respected at the Sochi Winter Games despite Russia 's new law on homosexuality .  To the stars : The torch will return to Earth on Monday , November 11  The move has been widely condemned and has led to calls for a boycott of next year 's event .  The issue caused controversy at August 's athletics World Championships in Moscow .  Russian athlete Yelena Isinbayeva labelled Swedish high-jumper Emma Green-Tregaro ` disrespectful to our country ' for protesting against the law by painting her nails in rainbow colours while United States runner Nick Symmonds dedicated his world 800 metres silver medal to his gay and lesbian friends .
