When I was 5, I was at a grocery store with my mum and there was a homeless man sitting outside.
We went into the store and bought a loaf of bread to give him.
When we paid and left, my mum gave it to me to give to him and when I did, he tried to spit at me.
He started screaming that bread won't pay for beer and weed and yelled at me to go away and bring money next time.
My mum and I quickly left after that, but as a 5 year old, all I wanted to do was be kind, like I'd been taught.
It really upset 5-year-old me.
