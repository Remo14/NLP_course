I was at a large rock festival.
Someone was being a douche and throwing tightly filled brown paper bags with grass and dirt.
They were not deadly of course... but could still cause a bit of pain.
I saw one of these grass-bags coming for the woman in front of me.
I quickly threw both my hands in front of her face to block the projectile.
Unfortunately I greatly miscalculated the bags trajectory and it fell out of her eye sight.
She just kept telling me, very sternly 'You need to leave, You need to leave.
'  She wouldn't even let me explain.
:(
