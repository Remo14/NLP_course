Lent a boss $250 to buy this pos car.
He had been diagnosed with ball cancer, I felt bad.
And I had some extra scratch I could lend.
He buys the car, which was a decent car and he got a great deal because it was from a relative.
Sells it for $2500, stopped offering be jobs (it was independent contract) haven't heard from him since.
Fuck.
