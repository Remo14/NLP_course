I just want everyone in this thread to know that after reading this thread on the couch in the dark at 11 PM, I got scared and reached over to switch on the lamp...and the light bulb POPPED LOUDLY AND WENT OUT.
The new bulbs are in the kitchen.
I'm too scared to get off the couch now.
I think I may be stuck here 'til morning.
