When I was in 9th grade, a girl who was a year above and who had once been my friend began to harass me.
She'd say mean things about me whenever I was in earshot, write shit about me on her public blog and send me horrible emails.
At one point, her and her gay sidekick tried to jump me.
I remembered that she had a big crush on Al Gore and I knew that she used Xanga religiously so I tried to log into her Xanga, using Al Gore as the password.
Lo and behold, it worked.
I deleted every single entry she had written.
She had her account for like two years and when she saw what had happened, she made a long post about how heartbroken she was.
