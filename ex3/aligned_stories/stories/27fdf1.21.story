My grandfather owns several forests around the village he lives in, and he drives through them every week, to check how the trees are doing and wether something needs to be fixed.
He really loves his trees and has a sharp eye for any potential sickness or insect that could pose a threat.
A decade or two ago, hitchhikers were very common.
Even in the thinly populated areas of bavaria, he encountered them regularly, and was always happy to help.
He literally picked up every single hitchhiker he found.
One day however, he had a bad feeling about one.
Without any reason, he dismissed this one hitchhiker standing on the side of the path.
Later that day, there was a radio broadcast about a previously convicted murderer who killed someone in the woods and got caught trying to flee by hopping onto someones car.
Just writing this down makes me shudder again.
