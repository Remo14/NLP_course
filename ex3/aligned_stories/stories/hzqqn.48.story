I've got an adopted half brother.
I'm 30 now and found out when my mum told me about 5 years ago.
She started to look up details but he was in his forties and still living with his adopted parents so she assumed they had a close bond and didn't get it touch.
It doesn't bother me.
I don't feel like I have a missing brother that I should connect with or anything.
