I recently posted a comment (no throwaway) about this girl I was into always talking to her ex-boyfriend and how it made me nervous.
3 days later, she texted me a direct link to my specific comment that was buried in /r/adviceanimals.
I told her that doesn't change the way I feel about her ex-boyfriend and we pretty much went downhill from there.
Big argument erupted and we are no longer speaking.
Also lost one of my friends who happened to be her best friend as a result.
In fact, there is a good chance she will see this comment since she was seemingly keeping tabs on me.
Hi, crazy.
