Really long story kinda short - threw almost every piece of furniture out of a 7th floor hotel room window (in an attempt to hide evidence of a vodka orgy gone wrong from the adults who were responsible for our tour group) on the last night of a student exchange trip to Moscow.
Had to pack everything I hadn't tossed out the window in less than a minute, then "fake left / run right" to escape the room with my bag after the maid/babushka's angry shouting woke me up a few hours later.
Immediately boarded a bus to the airport and left the country; never heard anything about it.
