At a truck stop, middle of the night.
Guy next to me starts talking to me.
He's 50ish, short, friendly, got a bushy mustache.
After a moment or two I notice that his mustache is actually his nose hairs which are inches long and obviously combed into the desired mustache shape.
I was both fascinated and repelled at the same time.
