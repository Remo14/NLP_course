So this didn't happen to me but I heard this from a friend when I lived in Japan.
The word "nigai" means bitter in Japanese.
But when you drink or eat something bitter you usually shout in surprise and say "nigga" because the i sound is often omitted just because it's easier.
So friend is sitting at a coffee shop and there are black people at the table beside.
He sits down with his friends and sips his drink then yells nigga.
The man at the table next to him turns and kind of laughs, but he realizes what he's done (since that word is very famous thanks to hip hop music) and feels the need to explain.
With his very poor English he tries to explain that he was given the wrong drink and didn't like it.
What came out was "I hate brack.
"
