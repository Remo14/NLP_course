The night of my brother's wedding, me and my girlfriend went back to our hotel.
Down the hall, there was an after party for a different wedding, with people in tuxes and bridesmaids dresses drinking and partying in their room.
As we walked by, the bride storms out screaming into a cell phone, telling someone to get back there right now.
As she hung up, she screamed into the room with the party "Who the fuck abandons their bride on their wedding night?!
" Apparently the groom was at a bar down the street with some friends.
Not sure if she constitues a bridezilla, since she made a good point.
Who the fuck leaves their bride on their wedding night?
