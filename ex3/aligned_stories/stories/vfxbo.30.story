This was a huge scandal in China a while back when i was living in Shanghai.
An elderly lady was crossing the street and was hit by a guy on a scooter.
She fell down was was injured while the man who hit her drove off.
A man nearby saw what happened and came over to help her up and offered to take her to a hospital.
The old lady freaked out and started accusing the man of hitting her which he didnt.
Her reasoning was "why are you offering to help me if you didn't knock me down in the first place".
She pressed charges and took him to court and it was a media frenzy in China.
I don't know what actually happened from the court case since you know the Chinese tend to make news stories mysteriously disappear if it gains too much attention
