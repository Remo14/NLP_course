About 13 years ago my sister (young teen at the time) started dating her first boyfriend (kid was 19).
He was completely obsessed, would verbally abuse her, etc etc.
As far as I know his abuse never got physical, but after she broke up with him he'd creep around our parent's house, call the house at 3am just to hang up, threaten her...he pretty much managed to piss me off.
So, said guy worked at a driving school where he corrected test quizzes after hours.
I drove there one evening with a friend to give him one last warning, he told me to fuck off or he'd call the cops.
So my friend and I took out my friend's aluminum baseball bat out of the trunk, tuned up the kids car a bit and, when he came outside, took one good swing to his legs.
Then I told him he could call the cops now.
He never did, the phone calls stopped, I never saw him again.
Not quite the dramatic story, but it's all I got.
