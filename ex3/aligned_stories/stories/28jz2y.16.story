I didn't do a throwaway but one of my top comments was simply "ha"

I told one of my friends that I had gotten tons of karma off of a simple "ha" and he said that he had seen it the other day, looked up the post, and found my username and now he pokes me about all the stupid shit I write on reddit.
He's probably reading this right now.
Hi, Hayden.
