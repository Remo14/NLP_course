Similar story, but with a worse ending.
Before I was born, my dads' cousin got married.
He and his wife went on their honeymoon, and one night he and his wife were walking by a bar when they spot two guys fighting violently.
So he got in the middle and broke it up before they got hurt, and both men began to walk away.
My dads cousin goes to walk away with his wife when one of the men turned around, pulled a knife and stabbed him in the back.
He passed away that night.
