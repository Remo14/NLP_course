In line at 7-11 behind an elderly woman.
She pays for her things and leaves.
There's a banana sitting on the counter.
Cashier looks up and calls out "Miss, your banana," but she doesn't hear.
I bolt after her and catch up quickly,  "Hey I think you left your banana inside.
"  
She turns to me and glares.
"I didn't want the banana you little shit," and continues walking away.
