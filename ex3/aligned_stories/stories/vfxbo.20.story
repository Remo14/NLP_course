A buddy of mine blew the motor in his truck.
I knew of a engine 200 miles away that would be a good replacement.
So I drive there pay $250 for it load in my truck and drive back.
I leave the motor at the local shop and it gets put in the truck.
One week later he sells the truck and never pays me for the motor.
