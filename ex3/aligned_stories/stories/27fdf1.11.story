Went camping with some friends on hill a few kilometers out in the woods from one of the guys house.
There's a few hiking/four wheeling trails in the area that lead up to the hill so it's known by the locals.
It was about midnight we had a fire going and were just sitting around having a good time, then the guy (there was 4 of us) sitting opposite of me yells who are you.
I turn around and there's this man, about 6ft tall staring at us from the edge of the woods with a big rock in his hand.
One guy knocked an arrow in the compound bow we had, the guy across from me grabbed the hatchet and I pulled  the knife off my belt.
We had no clue what we were doing but the guy wouldn't say anything to us.
He eventually just backed into the woods.
No sleep was had that night and we kept a very large fire going.
