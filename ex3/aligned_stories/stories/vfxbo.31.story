I also lived in Shanghai--here is a breakdown of what happened:

Case goes to court-Judges agree with the woman's family and force the man to pay a portion her medical bills.
This makes the news and the  lose their shit--the overall culture changes so that people refuse to help another without first getting evidence showing that they were not at fault.
Fast forward to a year ago--a little girl named Xiao Yue Yue gets hit by a truck somewhere in Guangdong province.
Nearly twenty people walk by without doing anything to help, little girl eventually dies.
Chinese people freak out once again--a new law gets hastily passed that protects people from being sued when they try to help someone else.
Not sure if it will be actually enforced or not.
