I ran a 500+ member clan and pretended to be a 27 year old north korean for like 5 years.
I knew where I lived and I was careful not to talk to real koreans ^^ I was the son of an officer.
I even did a fake accent over skype chat.
People believed me.
Then I got grounded when I was 14 and randomly explained to everyone.
Some people were like wtf and left, others were like holy crap you're an amazing liar.
Not as epic as SixofSwords, but it was pretty intense.
I was internet dating a 24 year old canadian too, she thought I was so smart and cool but I was 12 :D ^^;
