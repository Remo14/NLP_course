Back in the 70s, my mom found a bag in my room.
No one was around, so she figured she'd give it a try to see if it was as good as the hype.
She liked alcohol, and thought weed might be similar.
Sadly, she was prone to panic attacks at the best of times, and her first (and LAST!
) attempt at getting high provoked a real bad panic attack.
She was alone in the house and felt like she was going to die.
That made me kind of sad, when she told me about it years later.
She was nice enough to return the bag to where she found it.
