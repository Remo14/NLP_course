Not so much a pre-wedding bridezilla story, but during.
I was a bridesmaid in my older brother's wedding.
I had 2 fucking drinks at the wedding...2!
I felt fine.
My sister in law got mad because in one of the wedding photos there is one of me kissing a family friend of 15 years on the cheek because I haven't seen them in a while.
It was such a nice picture too.
The bitch said it was inappropriate and hasn't shown the wedding photos from the reception to anyone because: "3ll3hciM was drinking at my wedding and ruined some of the pictures".
