I was cashing out a client who came into the salon with her mother.
When I came back to the register to cash them out, there were two Asian ladies in front of me.
One of them was visibly older than the other one.
Since they were the only two people at the register, I assumed they were the duo I was supposed to cash out.
I confirmed, "Are you together?
" The younger lady went into a rage, cursing me out for being racist and assuming all Asians looked the same.
Turns out, the older lady wasn't her mother, and was just trying to buy a bottle of shampoo.
It was awful.
