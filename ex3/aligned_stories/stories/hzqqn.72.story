My friends and I were at the beach a few weeks ago.
We saw this flock of seagulls poking at this bag of flaming hot Cheetos.
Once they got it flipped over and spilled onto the sand, they devoured them.
While they were eating, I said "Hey wouldn't it be funny if they realized how hot they were?
" Not ten seconds later, in a huge flock, they ALL flew into the water in panic, plunging their heads into the waves, beaks open.
