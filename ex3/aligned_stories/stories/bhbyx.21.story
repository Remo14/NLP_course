Two young kids are upstairs in their room, playing their playstation.
All of a sudden they hear their mom's voice angrily calling for them from downstairs.
They're confused because their mom rarely if ever gets angry at them, and they tell her they will come in a minute.
They keep playing, but she screams out again telling them to come right away.
They get up and start walking towards the stairs, when their mom appears in a crevasse in a wall, quickly pulling them in and covering their mouths.
Scared, she puts her finger to her lips and tells "it's okay, I heard it too.
"
