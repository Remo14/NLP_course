I had a monkey on my key chain back in high school.
This chain was three links long.
One day I was walking out to my car and I heard something hit the ground.
I looked down to discover the monkey with links one and two of the chain still attached on the ground and link three still attached to my belt.
All of the links were still fused together, my only guess is the chain phased itself apart.
