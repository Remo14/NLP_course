In second grade i had this pokeball, like a little spring loaded one that was supposed to have a plastic pokemon inside, of course i lost that.
But anyways, one day i caught a wasp inside the ball as was super proud of myself, so i did what any second grader would do.
I took the thing to show and tell.
In front of my entire class i yelled "Go Beedrill!
" and let the wasp out.
it stung my best friend three times.
he wouldn't talk to me for a week.
