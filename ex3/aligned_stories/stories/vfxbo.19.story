Northeastern grad (as of Monday, when I take my last exam-- hooray) here.
Our architecture program is... special.
Not the good kind of special.
Just... special.
The pavement outside the architecture building is covered with spray paint from them failing to understand how to use a tarp when making their fancy multicolored buildings.
God help you if you get in between them and their styrofoam trees.
