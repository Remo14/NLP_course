In Korea the toilets in more rural areas rarely have toilet paper.
I was 14 visiting family for the summer and had to drop a huge deuce.
It came out like gravy; and it was then I realized I had no toilet paper or paper towels in the bathroom.
Unlike American toilets, most in Korea are the squatters, like this so I couldn't use the toilet water to wipe my ass with my hands:

There were a shitton of people in the bathroom, and for some retarded reason I decided to use my umbrella I had because it was raining, and I figured the rain would wash it away when I got outside.
When I went outside my aunt grabbed the umbrella, which was the only one we had, and yelled at me for taking so long and opened it up.
Small pieces of my feces flew on my entire family like we were gingerly coated with brown pepper.
Needless to say I have never returned to Korea
