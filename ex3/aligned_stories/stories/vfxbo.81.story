It was my first time in Holt Renfrew (a super-expensive, chi-chi store) and I had to use the ladies' room.
The whole bathroom was very elegant and nicely decorated.
In the stall they even had a lady's handbag hanging from one of the hooks as decor.
Or so I thought.
Until I realized another customer had forgotten their Christian Dior handbag in the stall.
I took it off the hook and was going to take it to see if there was a lost and found, or someone who could help me find the owner.
Right then, a frantic lady in her high heels and couture rushes into the washroom looking for her handbag, sees me with it, snatches it right out of my hands and yells at me for "trying to steal it.
"
