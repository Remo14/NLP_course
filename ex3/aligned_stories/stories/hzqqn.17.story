Okay this was something I was going to take to the grave with me, but I want to tell someone other than the 2 other people who know it.
One night when I was 8 my family and I lived in an apartment.
Now I had 4 people in my family and the apartment had only 2 rooms so my sister and I shared rooms.
In any case one night I had to pee, but for some reason instead of going to the bathroom I, in my half sleepy/sleep walking state, went on top of my sister's bed and peed on top of her headboard.
While this was happening, I thought it was a dream as I previously had some episodes of sleep walking and doing some funny things (like turning on the TV or having a non-coherent conversation with my parents), but the next morning arrived and my sister commented that her pillow was all wet and smelled musty and for some reason I couldn't remember that it was because of me.
Later my mom found out it was pee and I suddenly had a flash back of using my sister as a toilet seat.
I cried in terror at what I've done and to this day my mom and sister founds it hysterical, but not me.
I'm haunted to this day at what I've done.
**TLTR: I gave my sister a golden shower while she was asleep**
