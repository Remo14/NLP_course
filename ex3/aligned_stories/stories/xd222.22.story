One time I met a girl online, and for our first date we went bowling after a cheap dinner.
Well, as we're bowling, my dinner began to not sit well with me, and I had to run to the bathroom.
Before I can get my sexy first date jeans off, I proceed to poop myself a little bit.
I was able to make a save for most of it, but I certainly pooped on my pants and leg.
I was able to make a hasty cleanup operation in that bowling alley bathroom - enough so that I could proceed with the date without too much suspicion.
I didn't tell her this until more than a year after this date.
Three months ago, we got married.
I wish I could say this was the only time that I've pooped myself in her presence throughout our courtship.
