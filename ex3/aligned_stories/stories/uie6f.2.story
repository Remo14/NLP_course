I'm a hospice nurse.
When people are really close to death you have to be really careful with them.
You have to turn unconscious people every two hours to prevent skin breakdown.
Sometimes when you turn them, their lungs collapse and they die.
Sometimes they aspirate (inhale)their liquid medications, no matter how carefully or slowly you give them and they die.
Sometimes when you bathe them, they die.
Sometimes, I feel like a mass murderer and I really hate my job.
I'm really good at my job and I know that I make a positive difference in my patient's and families lives and I love that part.
I'm also scared because I don't cry any more or feel anything when people die, like my heart is a rock in my chest.
