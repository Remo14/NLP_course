A guy who was stalking me and my girlfriend found 2 of my throwaways.
They were both lucky guesses -- one only mentioned my general location in a comment, and the other didn't having anything that identified me other than behavior patterns -- but it was pretty damn creepy.
Since then I have made sure to include lies in my comments as well as changing my writing style.
(This guy is incompetent with women but has a complex where he thinks they owe him attention.
He stalks them out of interest at first, and then when they freak out and reject him hard, he stalks them to harass them.
Serious mental issues there.
