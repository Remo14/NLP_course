Not me but a coworker.
He bought a copy of Microsoft Office 2007 from Tigerdirect, but when he got the box, there were two boxed copies of Microsoft Office.
He called them up and told the customer service rep that he had received two copies, and only paid for one, so he wanted a shipping label to send the second one back.
They didn't believe him since the packing slip said one copy.
He eventually got a manager on the phone and they accused him of stealing the second copy and they were going to charge him full retail unless he paid to send it back, or at some point they were going to charge him and wouldn't refund him until they received it (again, with him paying shipping).
After a few days of phone calls back and forth and hours of wasted time, he ended up getting a label to ship the thing back to them.
As a result, he's probably never buying anything from TigerDirect ever again, or he said that if he does and that happens again, he's just keeping the thing, because they didin't even known about it until he told them.
Sad really, that someone wants to return over $100 in merchandise received for free, and has to fight to get a return label.
Anyways, he orders from Newegg now, like the rest of us that prefer decent customer service.
