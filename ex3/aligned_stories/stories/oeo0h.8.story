This happened to me in third grade, and it scared me so much I started crying and had to go to the office to talk to the principal about it.
I was in the hallway for misbehaving, and my neighbor Tad (a year younger than me) came walking out of a class to my right, passed in front of me and headed down some stairs.
We said "hi" to each other.
About 20 seconds later, he walked out of the same class, passed in front of me, and headed down the stairs.
I just stared at him, confused and afraid, and he looked back like "why the f are you looking at me like that".
I never realized how much it was like Matrix deja vu.
