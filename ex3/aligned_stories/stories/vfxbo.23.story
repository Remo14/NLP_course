Not trying to generalize but something that seems to occur with kids who get that kind of money from their parents is the devaluing of other people's money.
If you're someone who sees a $10k check (and I'm sure a lot of other handouts) regularly and suddenly paying someone back $500 seems like no big deal and other things become a bigger priority.
Happened to me - Had to call out a well off friend who asked for a loan because he didn't want his parents to know he was spending all his money on bar tabs.
He also go some sort of yearly gift.
When I brought it up when he hadn't paid me back after 3 months he nonchalantly said "Damn dude, didn't think it was a big deal.
It was just $250.
I was gonna get it to you..."
