My great-uncle Bob in his day was a trucker, and was passing through a bar in Utah with some friends.
In the bar, there were a group of men trying to prostitute an 11-year old.
Bob and his friends call them out on it, tell them that they better stop, etc., and it escalates to a fight in the parking lot.
The 'pimps' pull out baseball bats and beat my great-uncle and his friends over the head.
All of Bob's friends died, some instantly and some in the hospital.
My great uncle has never been right since :(
