2 years ago, I tried to kill myself.
I got up, showered, got dressed, put on my favorite perfume and tried to jump from the GWB.
On my way there, this man stops me, tells me I look like his wife who passed away.
Says I was just as beautiful and that she died on a day like this.
The light is still green, I cant cross, he is still talking.
He stops and tells me that whatever is going on i n my life that it will pass and that my life was precious.
I start crying and run home.
That old man saved my life.
