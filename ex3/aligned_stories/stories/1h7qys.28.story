One Halloween in high school, a friend of mine got indescribably high and pretty hammered and peed her pants in the bathroom.
We heard laughing and screaming and when we came in, one girl was laughing and pointing at the pants-peer who was to the point of tears.
When we asked what happened, she could only muster **"My vagina played a mean trick on me"**

They were apparently trying really hard to make serious faces in the mirror.
Easily the dumbest reason anyone has ever peed themselves.
