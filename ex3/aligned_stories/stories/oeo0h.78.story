I'm sure this has been posted before, but there are two things that have happened to me that were sort of "reality glitches"

The first time was when I was laying in my bed in my dorm room and looking out the window at the falling snow at night.
My room mate was across the room in his bed doing the same thing and we were both talking about how nice it looked when **bam** I blink and suddenly its daytime.
I look around confused and don't see my room mate anywhere in sight.
Freaking out and thinking that everyone in the world has disappeared, I go looking for him and eventually find him and I ask him what happened.
He had absolutely no idea what I was talking about and I asked him where did the night go and he says "We were both looking out the window looking at the snow when you just got really quiet and didn't say anything when I asked you questions so I assumed you were asleep, but when I looked over you were just staring there with your eyes open looking out the window and actually blinked a few times.
I just thought you were sleeping with your eyes open.
