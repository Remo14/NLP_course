We made a good friend of ours a roommate in a house we were renting, with her two bratty children.
She was unhappily employed stripping at the time.
We helped her get good interview clothes, get a good job at Home Depot, get her kids into both head start and therapy(they are both disabled) and helped her buy a house and move out.
As she left, taking everything not nailed down, she accused me of abusing her children and almost had me beat up.
Definitely punished for being nice there.
We lost the house we were renting because of her, and were homeless once again.
Luckily this was long before my son was born.
