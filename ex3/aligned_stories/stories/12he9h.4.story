When I was in high school I went on vacation with family and bought my then girlfriend earrings to surprise her with when i got back.
I came back to her introducing me to her new boyfriend and me subsequently being kicked to the curb.
2 years later we got to talking over facebook and I initiated a booty call.
Afterwords, She told me she had feelings for me again and i responded with "cool, i'm late for dinner, talk to you later" BEST MASHED POTATOES EVER WERE HAD.
