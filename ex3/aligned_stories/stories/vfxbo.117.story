In my early twenties I rented an apartment in the same apartment complex as some friends I'd known for about a month.
About three months into their lease they informed me they were behind in their rent.
Though I couldn't really afford it, and knew I'd never see the money again, I went ahead and cut them a check for $300 dollars so they wouldn't have to default.
They later began stealing car stereos in the complex, taking my car without permission, and eventually breaking the door down in my apartment because they claimed they had left some of their belongings inside.
Because the complex was shady and wouldn't fix the door I moved the frick out of there before someone broke in and murdered me.
Upon coming back to clean up and get the last of my belongings (when the lease eventually ran out) I was told the cops swung by because my friends had come back and began squatting in my vacant apartment after defaulting on theirs.
And finally, in a final act of "Let's-slap-zeescarlet-in-the-face," the person I loaned the money to got up in my face and started screaming he was going to kill me when I expressed distress over having my car taken without my permission yet again.
Looking back on it, he might have been on drugs.
