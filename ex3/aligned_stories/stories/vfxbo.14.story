SO I was outside this fast-food place that sold hot dogs.
I saw a homeless woman with a shopping cart trying to come out of the joint.
She was struggling to open the door, so I did the gentleman thing and held the door open for her.
I don't know if that hobo was on crack or what, but she started yelling at me, telling me that she didn't need any help and told me to fuck off.
I let go of the door.
Smacked her right in the face.
