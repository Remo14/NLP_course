Bridezilla is putting it mildly.
I once flew into a foreign country for this woman's wedding since I was a bridesmaid.
The time I was there I witnessed her: shoving her daughter, starving and neglecting her pets, constantly fighting with her fiance, trying to control what I ate, accused me of stealing from her since I took a Pepsi from the refrigerator after they said to make myself at home, freaking out the night before as we were setting up because everything was wrong.
After the day had come and gone and I flew home I get an email about a month later, "You really pissed everyone off!
They all found you rude and lazy.
My husband isn't calling you names he's only calling you out on how you are.
" I told her to have a nice life then blocked her from ever contacting me again.
Next thing I know, my family and friends are getting threatened and harassed, fake profiles were made with my name and photo, several message boards on Facebook have my name, number, and address up along with the biggest loads of bullshit for any random stranger to read.
