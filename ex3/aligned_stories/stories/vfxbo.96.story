My ma and I saw a woman leave the parking lot with her purse on her car, we followed her and honked at her to get her attention.
She sped off and her purse went flying so we did the obvious thing parked to the side and had me risk my life to get this woman's belongings.
After dodging traffic to pick up her damaged purse with wallet and cell phone we headed to address listed on the license/ID and gave her belongings to her brother and his wife.
They thanked us and gave us a bag of tea.
We thought that was the end of that, but they invited us to pray with them a month later.
They gave us a bible, a white dress and things got weird when this preacher man came to say the end of the world was coming!
That the end was coming if the middle east ever got its problems sorted out that it meant Jesus was coming!!!
We said we had to leave because I had school in the morning...so I didn't get accused of anything, but things still managed to get weird.
