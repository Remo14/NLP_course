Not a very spectacular story but true.
I've always felt some encounter stories were real, but what made me truly believe was one night standing outside watching the stars.
It was late, maybe 2 a.m., and out in the country so it was dark, no street lights, very little to no moon.
I was watching what I thought was a satellite moving across the sky from right to left.
Didn't think twice about it as I saw them all the time.
Suddenly, the "satellite" stopped and shot off FAST, totally disappeared, at a 45-degree angle from the direction it came.
I have never ever seen a satellite change direction ever.
It startled me so much I stood there for a bit wondering if I really saw it or not, but I did, 100% certain.
It's unfortunate no one was there with me that night.
