Boyfriend decided to help friend out and let him stay with him at his apartment.
Around this time I had come back from belgium with some cigars as a gift to him, now they weren't super expensive but sentimental.
Suddenly they started missing confronted everyone and he would always put the blame on others.
So after a while my boyfriend "J" decided to search through his stuff found the reminants of the cigars along with a glass pipe that J got me for my birthday.
Now if there is one thing I cannot tolerate is someone stealing things that were special to me...he confessed and should feel very lucky I had a staff meeting.
Fast-forward  a few years later we give another friend a place to to stay whats he do steals my flippin pipe.
Now I was upset, and both these people having the same name I am convinced people with that name bring bad jou-jou into my life.
