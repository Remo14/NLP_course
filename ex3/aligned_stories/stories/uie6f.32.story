The day I broke up with my ex-girlfriend, who had some mental issues (literally in and out of mental hospitals, etc.
It wasn't all bad, we really were good together at the time) is the day I had the police show up at my door.
She claimed I beat her, raped her, tortured, and abused her.
She had self-afflicted bruises/cut marks and had been having consensual sex for almost 2 years at that point, which was somewhat common knowledge amongst both families.
She eventually cracked and confessed to an investigator that she'd only done it because if she couldn't have me anymore, then I couldn't have anyone else ever.
I never even hit my own sister when growing up, much less ever disrespected a woman, even if she deserved it.
That entire following year was a social nightmare.
So many rumors in school.
After the ordeal people seemed to be sympathetic towards me, but I was just happy to have my name cleared.
