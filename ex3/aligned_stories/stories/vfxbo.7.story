I found a wallet outside on a patio by the smokers area at a bar one time.
So, as a smoker, I just hung out outside and asked everyone that came back out if they lost their wallet.
One girl was like "OMG I DID!?
" I asked her to describe it, she did, and I pulled it out and she was like "YOU!?
YOU TOOK MY FUCKING WALLET?
" I said "no, it was sitting on that bench right there, figured it was better if I try to find the owner than just let it sit there on a busy Friday night".
She said "I have every right to call the cops!!!!".
I just said "Wow, try to do a nice thing for someone..." and threw her wallet into the parking lot and went back inside the bar.
