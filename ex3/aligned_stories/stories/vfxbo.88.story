My sister used to work at a Jamba Juice.
One day, a lady came in asking for a smoothie original size.
My sister accidentally made too much and ended up giving the lady a power sized smoothie (one size larger than the original).
When the lady received the smoothie, she went up to my sister and said "I asked for an original.
" My sister replied "Yeah, I'm so sorry.
I accidentally made too much.
You only got charged for an original though so the rest of it is free.
" The lady responded "How am I supposed to drink more than I wanted?
" and then proceeded to pour the entire smoothie onto the floor and walked out.
