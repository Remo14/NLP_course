I used to work in a building that had three levels of sub-basements, with the piece of lab equipment I typically worked on in the lowest basement.
I had the only key.
There was a wired phone in there, and I did work late some nights... but not this night.
I was sleeping alone in my apartment when I woke up to a call on my cell phone from my girlfriend at 3 AM, she was in hysterics and asking why I scared her.
Apparently she received a call from that basement phone just a minute earlier, with someone who sounded like me slowly repeating her name, until crackling and fading out.
My apartment was 10 miles away from work.
I thought she was lying, but I saw the 3 AM call from the basement phone logged on her cell myself.
Still freaks me the fuck out.
