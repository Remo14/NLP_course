I once found a mobile phone on the floor on my way to college, and of course as any normal person would i took it, later that day i checked how much it would be worth if i sold it to one of those recycling websites like envirophone, which claimed i could get 50.
I then checked the phone to see if i knew who it belonged to, from pictures etc, turns out it was a kid who lived nearish to me who i didn't know very well.
Although i did know he was the kind of person that if he had found my phone would have sold it in a heartbeat, i played about with my two options for a while then decided that i would do the right thing in the hopes that someone would do me the same courtesy if i ever lost my phone i returned it to the house.
The kid didn't thank me and still hasn't thanked me to this day, just took the phone on the door step and said something along the lines of 'i thought i had lost this'.
I then lost my wallet (containing ID) a few days later and never got it back, so much for damn karma.
