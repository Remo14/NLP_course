I had a bridezilla moment once.
I'm generally pretty laid back and wanted to have a stress free wedding.
I gave my girls a color and let them wear what they wanted.
I was more excited than nervous or stressed.
But.
This damn caterer, who from day one went on and on about no hidden charges and his price was all inclusive, called me the day before my wedding to ask if I had found a rental company to supply the glassware and chairs for the reception...
I nearly lost my shit.
It ended up being a red solo cup reception.
