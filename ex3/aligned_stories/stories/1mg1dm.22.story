One time my daughter's hamster got loose and went under the stove.
For about a week we tried to get it out, but it would just hide under there where we couldn't reach.
Finally my husband tied a string around a piece of carrot and pushed it under the stove.
I was standing there making fun of him, but he dragged that carrot out and the hamster came out after it.
Genius.
