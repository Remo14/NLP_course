So I got down to doing some old research, since I never really looked into it.
I always assumed it was a green mamba, because it was, well, green.
A quick google revealed that black mambas can also be green, and that baby green mambas (such as the one I owned) are in fact YELLOW.
But based on the images I dug up, my little Salazar (he was more olive green, but not super dark) may very well have been a young black mamba.
Holy fuck.
Not to mention, he was fast as fuck and tended to stay on the ground in his terrarium, rather than in the branches as green mambas do.
Holy fuck.
