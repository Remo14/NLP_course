I attended the wedding of a family friend's daughter, so didn't really know her.
It was a nighttime reception, so probably from 6pm-11 or 12, the ceremony immediately preceding.
When we went into the reception, we were expecting a buffet or something to be set up, but there was nothing.
Later we found out that there was no food for the 120 guests, but rather a cheese spread, fruit platter, and vegetables with dip.
After an hour, people were really hungry and some people started to leave because they were expecting to be fed and didn't want to stay.
When the bride found out, she ran across the room in her dress and blocked the doors, screaming about how everyone is ruining her wedding and screaming "Bride's Day, Bride's Way!
" It was such a scene that her father had to peel her off the door (don't know where the husband was, probably cowering) and people who didn't know her that well all left.
I heard through the grapevine that she was inconsolable the entire night, got trashed and threw up (hopefully on her dress, but not sure).
Oh well, Bride's Day, Bride's Way!
