as I was exiting a Best Buy, I walked around a woman that was having security check her receipt as she left.
She was carrying an appliance, so I held the door open for her.
As she was walking through the door, I heard her talking in her cell phone about how some rude asshole just ran around her to leave the store (me).
Hearing this, I said, "Excuse me?
I was holding the door for you, you fucking idiot.
I hope you get hit by a bus!
"
Not my proudest moment, but the arrogance of some people just baffles me, especially when I was trying to do something nice...
