It involves an apartment in a complex in Coney Island in the 80s.
Seemingly deserted, the man inside invited me over to trade video games, which happened, but inside that apt... a refrigerator loaded top to bottom with pudding cups.
Three grand pianos covered in canvas tarps stuffed like puzzle pieces in the largest room, barely fitting (had to crawl over or under them) with a full ballroom chandelier (hung from the ceiling but too big to fit so it draped over the pianos.
)  Absolutely no furniture or electric appliances (except the fridge, his computer, and The Fan), no lamps, no tv, no toaster, nothing.
His bedroom had a bunk bed (he lived alone) and the window had been removed completely and replaced with a massive industrial fan that blew air into the room like a hurricane - this fan would blow floppy disks off the desk so they were weighted down with pudding cups.
He lived on the 13th floor.
The man himself was (I shit you not) absolutely normal looking.
I have no idea how I made it out of there alive; god smiles on fools and madmen, and this story had both.
