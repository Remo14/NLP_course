I occasionally suffer from sleep paralysis.
It developed in my early twenties, and I've had the alien abduction dream.
My dad and I loved to watch shows about aliens, so I assume people who claim they were abducted had some form of sleep paralysis.
It started with flashes of blue light, and I felt myself being lifted out of bed by the chest.
I was blinded by a white light, and I could hear a loud mechanical whirring.
When I woke up, I was sitting up in bed with my chest stuck out.
My arms were holding me up.
The experience was the most intense sleep paralysis dream I've ever had.
I can see how someone else could have that dream, panic, and tell everyone about it.
