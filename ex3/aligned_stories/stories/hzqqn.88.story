I heard this one from a stand-up comic guy (can't remember his name), but it's one of those "what in the fucking fuck" stories.
And it's true from what I heard.
I know I couldn't make up something like this.
So this guy was an EMT and had a 911 call about a woman about to give birth, but she didn't have anyone to take her to the hospital.
So the ambulance showed up, and the EMT actually had to partially put his hand inside of the woman's vagina to keep the baby's head from laying wrong and getting complications.
When they got to the hospital, the doctors realized they had to perform an emergency c-section on the mother.
The whole time, the EMT has not taken his hand out of the mother's vagina.
So the doctor performs the c-section and the baby comes out of her stomach, and then the doctor REACHES INSIDE THE MOTHER and shakes the EMT's hand while still inside her vagina for a job well done.
That's fucking fantastic if you ask me.
