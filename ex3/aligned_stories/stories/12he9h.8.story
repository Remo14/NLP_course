At my previous job I worked with a "story topper".
You know, she did it way better, cooler, and sooner than everyone else.
She even started using my stories.
I was very irritated.
I started taking a pen or two a week from her desk.
Sometimes it was some little doo-dad.
I would casually snatch an item then take it to the mens bathroom where I would put it into a hole near the sink pipes.
It sounds stupid, but it made me feel like a bad ass.
I wish I could be there when they have to repair that sink and find all of her supplies in that wall.
