My mother had amassed 30,000 of debt without me knowing and on the day of receiving a surprising eviction notice, she tries to commit suicide by overdosing on opiates (think it was oxycontin/oxycodone and bunch of other shit), I phoned emergency services and essentially save her life.
Well now this debt is on me, and whilst she was being tended to my 8 month pregnant fianc and I have nowhere to live and I just quit my job to become my mother's full time carer (she has 2 chronic conditions).
Well I Have to deal with debt, get all our possessions out of the old house, find a new one, and so on and so forth, you kinda get the idea, but yeah essentially the gist is I have absolutely no money, and because of this and only this reason my entire family now has disowned me and hates the living guts out of me just because I didn't have the money to commute to the hospital every day.
I mean seriously, If I didn't make the call I did she'd be fucking dead, and because of such an insignificant thing I got hate messages on everything, social networks, emails, phones etc.
I now only talk to my mother once a week through a text message, and before that point, since the age of 10 I have been looking after my mum's chronic conditions the entire time, It feels like shit to have devoted your entire life to one person, to have your entire family disown you and your mother to not want to talk to you anymore, she's not even grateful for me saving her life even though she's happy about being alive still, she actually hates me for it.
What the fuck did I do wrong...
