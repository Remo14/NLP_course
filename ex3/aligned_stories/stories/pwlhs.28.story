Oh nooooo.
My boyfriend's landlord is my French teacher from high school.
It's not a bad situation- I was a good student, and it's not like the landlord is over all the time.
One day, the boy was going down on me- it was the middle of the day and nobody else was home, so I felt no fear in loudly expressing my appreciation.
Once I had finished, there was a sharp knock on the door of his room.
"Hey, rent's due... Good job!
" the landlord called.
Apparently he had been standing out there waiting.
While I appreciate his allowing me to finish, I still can't look the guy in the face.
