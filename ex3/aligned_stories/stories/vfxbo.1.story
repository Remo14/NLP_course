Found a cell phone in the middle of the street.
Nobody was around so I figured I should check the contacts to find out who owns.
Figured "home" was a safe bet.
I call and start talking after they pick up, only to be torn apart by the owner's mom, who thinks that I've stolen it (apparently the phone was lost the day before and they were looking)
Anyways, the dude who owned it gave me 30$ for returning it and 10$ for "dealing with his mom".
So, my good deed was punished but I got a reward for being punished?
