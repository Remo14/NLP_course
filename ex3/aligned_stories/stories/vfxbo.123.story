I was playing tennis with some friends, and a woman and her kids (around 4 years old or so) walked by with their new puppy.
Puppy got loose, got hit by a car, and ran away.
My friends and I saw this, dropped our racquets, and ran after the puppy as it sprinted through the apartment complex, while the mother stood there and wigged the fuck out.
The 4 of us combined probably covered a mile and half with all of the running (scared puppy didn't realize how tired or hurt it was, I think), and we finally cornered it in some brush.
I climbed down a hill through the brush, and we took the dog back to it's very excited owners.
I got covered in poison ivy from crawling through the brush.
