Ive been waiting for the perfect time to tell this story on here.
I was at a huge car show with some friends.
We were walking around admiring all of them and then I pointed ahead of us to a car we were approaching.
As soon as I raised my finger a bee landed on the very tip for my finger.
I exclaimed loudly, "look at that crazy thing!
" I kid you not there was a black midget with no arms standing about 5 feet in front of me.
Probably top three most awkward moments of my life.
