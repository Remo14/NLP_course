Laughter equals guilt?
This is terrible reasoning.
Of course the eleven and nine year old boys thought it was comedy gold.
I would have suspected either your outraged brother whose overreaction would look suspicious, or the girl who hadn't moved since the evidence was produced.
Send the two youngest boys away and interrogate the two suspicious characters.
Present them with stories of desperation and no TP.
See who cracks.
I would've had you.
