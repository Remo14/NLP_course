This isn't exactly creepy, but it's one of the scariest things that's ever happened to me.
I was driving down the motorway with my boyfriend in the passenger seat, and my dad in the seat behind my own.
My dad is an epileptic and his fits are extremely sporadic.
Sometimes he goes extremely stiff and other times he will try to get out of places or grab and punch people.
Mid-conversation I felt his hands wrap around my throat as I was driving, pulling my head back and making it increasingly difficult to drive.
My boyfriend managed to help steer the car into the hard shoulder but it was one of the scariest experiences in my life.
