Not as bad as your story.
I found an iPhone 3g at the Disneyland parking lot.
I kept it charged going home, no calls.
Woke up to it before work and let the owner's gf's know I had the phone and they could pick it up.
I gave them my number since I couldn't text out of his phone.
They kept asking me to leave work and drive 40 minutes out of my way to give it to them.
Finally they came to my work, I asked them to unlock it in front of me to verify ownership.
When I handed it back to them they said "Wasn't there a case to this?".
When I told them I didn't have it, the gf said "ok"  and just walked off.
