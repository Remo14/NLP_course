I slept-walked one day and was having a vivid dream.
Because I was in a dream, I thought I was in the living room, but I had to pee extremely bad.
I kept walking from one exit to the other exit of the room trying to get out, but because I was really in my bedroom and the door was located in a completely different place in my room, I could never find the knob to find the door.
I ended up crying and pissing on myself.
It was one of my most shameful experiences.
