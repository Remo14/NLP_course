So my church sells food as a way to fundraise money every sunday.
(Vietnamese church so its spring rolls, vegetable rolls, sticky rice and the sort).
Well I was asked(more like demanded) to carry a tray of food upstairs, I obliged slightly frustrated because I was in the middle of helping a friend find someone.
On my way up a lady with some small childeren asked if she could buy some, but she realized she didn't have any money so she asked her husband to run to the car and get some.
Because she had small childeren, and there was already other trays of food heading up I stayed and waited a few minutes.
While waiting a woman who was "in charge" saw me standing there and started freaking out and telling me to bring the tray upstairs, as if I didn't know where to go, or as if I was stoping to talk to some friends.
At this point someone else came to me to take the tray, implying I was too useless to do a simple task.
