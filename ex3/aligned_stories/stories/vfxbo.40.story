I found a purse in a grocery basket once.
I went across the street, got myself an ice cream cone, found the driver's license, looked her up in the phone book, and called.
She accused me of stealing it and started saying she was calling the police.
She threatened me with police reports and litigation.
I told her "OK, your purse will be sitting in the parking lot then, better hope someone less honest than me doesn't find it before you do".
I drove back across the street, tossed the purse in the parking lot, and drove home.
