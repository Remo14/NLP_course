I was on the bus and noticed some guy on his blackberry, dozed off for a few minutes and woke up and noticed the guy left his phone on the bus.
I picked it up and tried to find a number in it i could call to let him know i had it.
Checked his facebook and saw he updated  his status from home saying some thug on the bus robbed him he also said how horrible people are in Los Angeles, how its a city filled with thieves and shit.
I updated his status correcting him, and letting him know i had it and i that i could sent it to him.
He emailed me his address and i mailed it to him.... he didnt even send a thank you email back, guy was a prick.
