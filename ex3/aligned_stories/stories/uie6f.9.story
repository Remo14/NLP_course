My ex-boss kept hounded me for two weeks if I could find him an ounce of some weed.
One day he said that he had back problems and he really needed something.
I felt sorry for him so I was able to find him an ounce of some bud &amp; sold it to him.
Three day's short of a year later I was arrested and charged with a felony.
I don't sell weed.
I'm not a dealer.
I was able to pin point the only time I've ever sold anything to anyone.
Now i'm stuck with a Class D Felony for Distribution of Marijuana... fucking sucks man..
