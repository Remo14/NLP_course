Someone raped a female friend of mine, and she wouldn't go to the police about it.
(The guy was drunk and forced himself on her, she doesn't drink).
Caught the guy from behind one night by chance and beat and kicked the shit out of him, took his wallet, and left.
(Lived in a bad area at the time, a guy getting mugged late at night was nothing more than a statistic.
I figured a completely random beating might have drawn more attention).
I later found out that he'd done the same thing to at least one other woman.
I have zero regrets, beyond not thinking enough to aim for his genitals more.
I'm pretty sure I'd have a lot more trouble sleeping at night if I'd done nothing.
