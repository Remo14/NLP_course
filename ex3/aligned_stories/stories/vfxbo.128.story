It's nowhere near as bad as some in here, but I regularly try to feed meters around me if I see they're expiring.
One day I was walking to my car when I saw the meter maid a few cars down.
I looked at the meter next to me, so I filled it, then walked around and started getting into my car.
The guy yelled over and asked if that was my meter.
I told him it wasn't, as I was basically in my car trying to leave, and he told me to stop and wrote me a $50 ticket.
Ugh.
