A man tried to mug me and I proceeded to beat the ever loving shit out of him for it.
It was a fight or flight reflex and my instant, unthinking reaction was to go completely berserk.
I kind of blacked out and had to be pulled off the guy and his whole face was bloody and he was unconscious.
I got arrested and questioned and the police let me go because he decided not to press charges.
My reaction was above and beyond acceptable force, hence the possibility of me being charged with a crime.
Honestly I don't regret it.
Maybe the mother fucker will think twice before he approaches a 5'2" woman and thinks he can scare her into turning over what little money she has.
