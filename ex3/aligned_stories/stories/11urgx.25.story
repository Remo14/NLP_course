My friend showed me this drinking game called Tourette's.
It involves a normal deck of cards and two players.
The top card is flipped, and whatever first letter the card name starts with, you have to shout out a random word that starts with the same letter.
For example, a three shows up.
If you don't yell "TIGERS" first, you lose and you drink.
I flipped a nine and loudly and quickly yelled NIGGER with the biggest smile on my face because I won!
This was in the middle of a party.
