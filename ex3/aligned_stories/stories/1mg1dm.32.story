When I was in elementary school (the school had roughly 400 students, about 7-12 years old), our teacher got sick so we got a substitute teacher.
The problem was that this one was a bitch and everyone hated her.
She was about 60, wore clothes that a teenager would wear, talked in the phone with her friends all the time during class, and when someone said something against her she would go "I'm older than you kids so I know better".
Just did very annoying and degrading stuff all the time, while not being a very good teacher in general.
So, probably a few weeks later (can't remember exactly how long) everyone on our class of ~25 people had gotten sick of her bullshit, so we decided to make an address demanding that we get a new substitute teacher because this one was bad.
Everyone in the class wrote their signature on the paper and we took the paper to the principal.
The next day we got a new teacher.
The bitch still stayed in the school, just taught someone else instead.
Anyway, I thought it was pretty cool for kids that were 10-11 years old to do something like that.
