One time I took a dump that was so long, that even when trying to aim it down the hole at the bottom of the toilet it still stood up out of the water.
When I pinched it off it had to fall one way.
It fell forward and scraped across the backside of my ballsack as it fell.
Tickled a bit, but was mostly startling more than anything.
You don't expect to feel something on the back of your ballsack when you're taking a dump.
Thought it could be a spider or something...but then I realized...
