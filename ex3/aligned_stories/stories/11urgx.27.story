Thankfully no one outside my head saw it, but I was waiting in the lobby at work for someone once and just to waste time started flipping through the guest sign in book.
And found myself giggling that every day at the same time (3:15) Jesus would sign into the guest register.
Rolled my eyes at some of the religious nuts I work with.
A few minutes later (3:15) the building's Latin American cleaner came into the lobby, signed himself into the guest book (outsourced employee, so had to sign in), and let himself into the building.
I just kinda kept quiet and tried not to blush as I realized who "Jesus" actually was.
