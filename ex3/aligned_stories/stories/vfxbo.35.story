When I was 9 I was playing in the parj with some other kids.
One kid who was like 3 slipped and fell because it was raining, he started crying.
His mom wasnt paying attention talking on her phone like the stupid fucking cunt she is, so I picked up the kid and took him over to the woman.
I said ma'am, your son fell down.
She starts screaming (still on the phone) at me like "WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU, YOU COULD HAVE HURT HIM," and she starts cushioning the kid.
Then she goes over to the grandma and starts bitching her out like "HOW THE FUCK COULD YOU LET HIM DO THAT, CONTROL HIM," and my tiny little old grandma says, "Okay, next time I'll tell him to leave your toddler with his face in wet sand, while you babble to your whore friends about how big your vaginas are.
" And we promptly left.
