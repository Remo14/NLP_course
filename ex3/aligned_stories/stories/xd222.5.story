A girl I took a class with told me about a meetup with a guy she met online.
She invited him to her workplace so that they'd meet in a public area with other people around.
He texted her from the parking lot and asked if she had any napkins or tissues that she could bring to him.
Apparently he felt the need to "take care of business" prior to seeing her but had no way of cleaning himself up.
She brought him some napkins and told him she never wants to see him around again.
