I was bartending one evening and an African American gentleman came in.
He sat at my bar, ordered a pint of Bud Lite, and started watching the game.
After I poured his beer, I entered his name in the computer system as BL GUY, for Bud Lite Guy.
I never considered that he may not read it as such when I gave him his check.
