I was driving back home to Los Angeles with a friend of mine after visiting family near Phoenix, AZ.
We were headed west on highway 58 just out of Boron, CA en route to Mojave to catch the 14.
It was night and we were jamming out to some music.
The next thing I know I'm waking up, looking around and realizing that I was pulled over on the side of the road and that aproximately 3 hours had passed.
My buddy was fast asleep so I woke him up and we both kind of had a psychological meltdown.
After we calmed down a little we went home and never really spoke of it since.
I have absolutely no idea when or how we transitioned from listening loud music and driving down the road to waking up safe on the side of the road.
