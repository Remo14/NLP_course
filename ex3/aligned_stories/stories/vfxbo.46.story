A friend got arrested with a shit-ton of traffic tickets.
He called me, and I got up in the middle of the night, drove to another city and spent over $1500 bailing him out (and several hours waiting on processing).
I didn't hear back from him for a long time.
Its cool, I figure he's embarrassed about the money.
7 months later he emails me wanting to come over to my house.
Guess he wants to talk about paying me back.
We work out a day/time and he shows up, makes infinitesimal small talk, and then launches into an Amway presentation.
Threw him out of the house.
