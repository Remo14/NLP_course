I used to work at a place that sold used car batteries in a predominately black neighborhood.
We used to mark these batteries with white stickers that read "Econo Power" to mark with date codes for warranty purposes.
Cue an older black gentleman walks in wanting to discuss his warranty and that his battery is bad.
There is no sticker so I say to him, "We can only warranty batteries the the 'White Power' label on them.
" He gets rather wide eyed and asks me "What kind of sticker" to which I reply again, "White powe.....Oh, Ummm one second.
" I head to the back laughing hysterically and make a co worker go finish taking care of him.
He finishes his business, gets a new battery and tells the co worker he'd like to see me before he goes, I walk up still giggling like an idiot and he says to me "White Power my ni**a" And we shook hands and had a laugh about it.
