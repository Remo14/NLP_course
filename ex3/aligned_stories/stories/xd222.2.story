I went out with this guy and we ordered the exact same drink.
He somehow got shitfaced while I remained sober.
I guess he didn't drink that much.
Anyways, he started acting completely obnoxious, being way to affectionate towards me, trying to kiss me on the cheek and putting his hand on my thigh.
I got up to go to the bathroom and he said "Wait, I have to tell you a secret first!".
He leaned in like he was going to whisper something to me...and then...he licked my ear.
I left.
He followed me to the train and kept begging for a goodnight kiss.
He still comes into my work all the time, and when my boss sees him walk in, she actually lets me leave and go to the McDonalds next door until he leaves.
