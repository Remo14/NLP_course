During the winter I was a part time ski instructor.
I didn't have a lesson so another instructor asked me to calm down a crying kid in his group.
I asked the kid's name and he said, "Nichols, but you can call me Nick.
" I replied with what I thought was a rational response.
"Okay Nick, what's wrong?
" 

The kid wails/cries at the top of his lungs,"why does everybody call me Nick!?
"

I didn't have anything to say to that.
