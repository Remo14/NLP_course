I was with my field training officer on what I think was my 2nd week in training when we got a call for a suicide.
It's the middle of August in the south and we arrive and park in front of the house.
We step outside and immediately smell death.
This guy hung himself in a barn and decided to tell no one about his plan to kill himself.
So he's been marinating on the August heat for two weeks before someone smelled him.
We walk inside and my partner points out that two rats are eating chunks out of his eyes and tells me to get up there and shoo them away.
I find a ladder nearby and grab a stick when I lose my balance and grab the nearest thing.
It's his rotting body and apparently the weight of both of us could not be supported by the beam so I land on my back and his entire bloated body lands on top of me and bursts open from his stomach.
I had his smell on me for what seemed like months, and ever since then I won't deal with that shit anymore.
