Want one worse?
As a youngling, (somewhere Kindergarten or 1st grade) I attended a rather large easter-egg hunt.
This was put on by a group with some decent funding, so some of the eggs had prizes you'd get for finding them.
I spot one in a tree and climb my little ass up there to retrieve it.
When I get down and crack it, the prize is a fucking remote control plane.
*YES YES YES* I think, and say, as I run over to turn it in.
As I hand the lady the slip, she tells me "this is a big kids toy, I can't give it to you", and she gives the plane to her son.
I didn't even get a replacement toy of any kind, and because I had to run from all the way across the field, I missed out on prime egg-hunting time to find something else.
In the end it was the only egg I pulled, because I saw it in a great hiding place, and I made a bee-line for it while disregarding the lesser, more obvious, eggs.
