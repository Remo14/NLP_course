My crazy ex-boyfriend told me one day while we were still dating that I loved my 10 week old kitten more than him.
He asked me that night if he could take him home with him to keep him awake during the drive.
I said no, but he took him anyways.
The next morning he called to tell me that he woke up late, jumped out of bed, and "accidentally crushed him with both feet" in his exact words.
He was all kinds of crazy, and this may even be the least terrible thing he did in our short time together.
I really hate that guy.
