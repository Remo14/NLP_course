This is a story about my mother told to me by my grandmother.
My mother and her family lived in rural Kansas in the 60's.
It should go without saying that there were very few black people there at the time.
Well, one day when my mom was about 4, my grandmother took her into the city to run some errands.
When they get to the city, my mom saw a pretty little black girl with braided hair and a very nice Sunday dress.
(Remember, these descriptions are from my grandmother.
) My mother, having not ever seen a black person before, was very shocked and exciting!
She immediately tugged on my grandmother's dress yelling, "Look mommy a MONKEY!
" My grandmother immediately put her hand over my mother's mouth and left the area.
