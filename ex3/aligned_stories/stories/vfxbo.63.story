When I was a young boy I went to the roller skating rink.
I was eleven and having a really good time.
I noticed that there were a small group of four kids skating with their mom.
She was in front of them when one of them fell over, so I skated over and helped him up by lifting him by his underarms.
She turned around and saw him struggling to stand and started yelling at me for knocking over her 5 year old.
I started crying because this 40 year old was yelling at me for helping.
It was then one of my teachers came over and took me away from the lady, then I got in more trouble even when I tried to explain myself.
