I had the exact same thing happen to me!
I was supporting a party with a company I work for and everyone had cleared out.
The DJ let me know that somebody had left their purse behind.
I went inside the purse and used the phone to call her friends...telling her friends that I had the girls purse and where my house was.
30 minutes later she comes in storming in drunk accusing me of stealing her purse.
I told her why the hell would I have her come to my house if I had stolen it.
Her friends that were with her were embarrassed for her and she kept yelling at me.
I called her a cunt, threw her purse at her, slammed the door, and told her to get the fuck out of my house.
She apologized profusely the next day.
