Second ex-girlfriend was waiting for me in the living room about 4 days after we broke up.
I forgot she had the second key to my apartment.
She had a cup of wine in her hand and a fuckin knife.
I fucking ran for my life and called the police.
They got there in time and arrested her.
Pants were shat on.
