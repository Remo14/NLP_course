Something similar happened in my town.
This guy would break into houses and stand over people as they slept.
One night, a man looked over his wifes shoulder into the backyard and saw some man (the creeper) searching through their bushes and even shot at him (I live in Texas.
People have guns.
Deal with it) Eventually this dude turns himself in and not only is he my best friends neighbor I sat with this dude at lunch during this whole fiasco of trying to find this stalker and he played it off a little too well.
Turns out he just did shit tons of drugs.
Shit tons.
Doesn't remember half the stuff, like being shot at.
lol
