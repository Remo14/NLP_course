At the age of 14ish me and a friend were outside a jewelry store.
We looked at a showcase, and just for fun I tried lifting the glass up, which turned out to be unlocked.
We look at each other, and decide to tell them.
We enter the big scary jewelry store, and tell the manager they forgot to lock it.
She goes out, locks it, and looks at us with the meanest face, and asks: "Did you steal anything?".
We just say no and leave, quite shocked at that response.
