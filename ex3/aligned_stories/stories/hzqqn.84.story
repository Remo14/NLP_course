A few years ago, I was at a college house party.
I had to take a mean shit, so I went upstairs to the bathroom.
In a drunken stupor, I decided it would be funny to upper decker the toilet.
After finishing up and placing the lid back on, I needed to wipe.
As I glanced around I noticed a robe hanging on the door.
I flipped it inside out and proceeded to wipe using the arm sleeves.
I then flipped it back to its original state and hung it back up.
To this day I don't know who the owner of that house was, but I apologize.
