My friend got a DUI when we were still in highschool.
He got his car taken away, he cried about it with his girlfriend there.
I felt super bad so I offered to sell him my bike for the $20 it would cost to fix the tire.
He gave me $20 and it cost $15 to fix the tire.
He says thanks.
The next week I see he's got a new bike, he sold mine and bought a better one.
We aren't friends anymore - after more bs like that.
