I was on the New Jersey turnpike at about 3 am with a load of pork coming out of PA.
I'm just driving along singing along to the radio when I notice a shadow way up in high beams.
I start slowing down and try to figure out what this thing is.
I thought maybe it was a deer or something.
No, it wasnt a deer, it was a goddamned horse.
There was a horse trotting down the interstate.
