Last year, my family went to Zacatecas, Mexico for the holidays with an uncle of mines from Wisconsin.
Somehow my uncle had a handgun there which is highly illegal, he got drunk and was firing off some rounds in the air.
My parents freaked out and when my uncle was not looking, my mom got the unloaded gun and hid it in her luggage.
Somehow she managed to forget about it.
They took a plane from Guadalajara to Tijuana then were picked up and came back by car home.
My family was unpacking and my mom instantly freaked out, there was a handgun in her luggage.
She successfully smuggled out a handgun from Mexico to the United States.
tl:dr My mom is a weapons smuggler.
