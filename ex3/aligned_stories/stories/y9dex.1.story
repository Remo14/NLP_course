I knew a woman who was a bridesmaid in a relatives wedding.
She was married and had been trying to get pregnant for a while.
Finally, her and her hubby got lucky and she conceived.
The bridezilla got furious and kicked her out of the wedding because she would be pregant in the pictures.
3 months later, sadly, the woman miscarried.
The bride called her with a response along the lines of "good, well now you can be back in the wedding.
"

Needless to say, she did nto even attend it.
