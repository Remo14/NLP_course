My story was an accident, because I didn't know racism was wrong at the time.
I was living with my grandparents in a small town of Arkansas while my dad was in Germany.
I had lived with them for about 4 years before my dad was restationed to Biloxi, Mississippi and I went to live down there.
Now in Ar we only had 1 black student in our whole school (K-12) and everyone referred to him as "The nigger".
I never knew that word was bad because everyone said it and he never reacted to it.
When I moved to Biloxi about half of my class was black and me being the new student I was asked to introduce myself to the class.
The first thing I said was "Hi my name is yanrogue, I can't believe how many niggers you have here, we only had one in my old school.
" After a very long explanation everything went much better and I learned racism is wrong.
