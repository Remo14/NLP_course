I took my wallet out to donate some money to Buddhist monks, and I heard a loud *PING!
* I looked around and couldn't find the source of the noise, so I gave them money and went along with my day.
I drove to a store, and filled out some job applications.
Back at my car, I discovered that my keys were locked inside of it.
Fortunately, I kept a spare key in my wallet!...
which was missing from its pocket.
The noise I heard was my spare key falling out of my wallet when I went to donate to monks.
I called my dad and he brought a spare key for me.
I'm pretty sure karma isn't supposed to work like that.
