At 12 years of age my mom let me stay in the truck as she went grocery shopping.
As I wait I see an old Guy walking towards the truck with an indescribable look at me as if I know too much.
he stops 5 feet from the truck looks at me for a coupple seconds and heads back the exact way he came.
it was rather traumatic for some reason andvery confusing at that age.
5-6 years later my dad was showing me home videos of us at Yellowstone.
at old faithful I noticed the same Guy,same look, same clothes peering at us on camera and at me through the TV.
I'm freaked out just telling this.
