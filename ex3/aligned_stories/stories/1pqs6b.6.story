My great uncle was a trucker in and around San Fransisco in the 40's, whose route often took him over the huge hills for which the city is known.
His truck wasn't all that powerful, so he usually had to stick it into a really low gear and crawl up the hills.
One day, his little brother, my grandfather, was visiting him and was sitting in the passenger seat, when my great uncle saw a friend coming up behind him.
His friend had a better truck and was able to climb the hills faster and so was going to be over taking them soon.
My great uncle had an idea for a prank and had my grandfather take the wheel while he jumped out of the cab.
When my uncle's friend passed them, my uncle was behind the truck, pushing it up the hill.
