A few years ago I went to Tokyo Disneyland (while living in Japan at the time).
I flew from Osaka to Tokyo.
The flight out was fine, but on the way back they confiscated a teeny, tiny spray bottle of eye-glass cleaner from my carry-on luggage.
This was actually before the days of restrictions on liquids, so it was extra annoying.
They told me they could hold it in the plane's cargo and I could retrieve it later.
Instead I just threw it out.
The flight was uneventful, and when I got home that night I unpacked my backpack completely to find that I had left a pack of matches in there from my *last* trip.
