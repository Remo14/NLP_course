I feel sorry for the people who marry bridezillas, and those who even have to be around and deal with them.
I am getting married in a month and my fiance is the furthest thing from a bridezilla, which I am very happy about.
Her mom and grandma are worse to deal with than her.
We both have been super laid back about the whole planning process.
Honestly I dont get what all the hype about weddings are.
You are getting married, isnt that the idea...not showing off.
If something goes wrong, so be it, its life, nobody is perfect.
