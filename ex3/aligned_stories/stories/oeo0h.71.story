I was eating popcorn in front of the TV and dropped a piece.
When it should have hit the ground, I heard a faint "pop" noise.
My mom was a stickler about messes, so I looked all over, under the couch, under the TV stand, everywhere, and couldn't find that popcorn.
About a year later, I'm watching TV again, and I hear the same faint "pop".
I look down, and right between my feet, is a freshly popped kernel of popcorn.
I picked it up, and it was still warm.
I'd been sitting there for at least an hour, and there was nobody else in the room.
Quantum popcorn.
