When I was about fifteen, my mom brought a new kitten home.
One day I was struck with the idea to pull off what I thought was a clever prank.
I laid a pretty big steamer in kitty's litter box, and carefully buried it.
About a day later, my mother is scooping the litter box and discovers the turd.
She immediately concludes that kitty is sick and takes him to the vet.
They couldn't figure out why kitty would take such a huge shit, and determined that he was healthy.
I haven't told anyone in my family about this incident.
To this day, the mystery of "kitty's big poop" is brought up occasionally, and I have to do my best not to laugh.
