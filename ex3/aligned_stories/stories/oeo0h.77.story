About a year ago, an online friend's cat ran away.
He was inconsolable, since he grew up with the cat and it was basically one of his best friends.
I vaguely recalled him telling me a long time ago that the cat had run away for three days once, and had gotten stuck in a local barbecue restaurant while it was closed for the weekend.
I didn't mention it, because I figured it would make my friend more upset.
Three days later, the cat comes back, smelling like barbecue sauce because it got stuck in the restaurant over the weekend.
My friend swears the cat had never run away before, and I could find no record of the supposed "cat ran away" conversation in any of our chat logs.
He never even mentioned there was a barbecue restaurant near his house.
