I tried to take a wallet that I found to my nearest the police station, which was not near where I found the wallet - the clerk was really rude and wouldn't take it.
She told me to pull behind the next police I saw in the city I found it and give it to them.
(Uhh...no thanks.
)  I told her I was going to walk outside and throw it in the trash if she wouldn't take it.
She finally sent a cop out to help me.
It was a huge hassle.
Next time, I'll just let the punk kids take the wallet instead.
:/
