when I was 11, I was bullied a lot.
I LOATHED this kid on the schoolbus named "Pete" would smack me on the back of the head even though I would mind my own business.
we got off the same stop because our houses were on the same street.
One day I got fed up, when we exited the bus I found a huge stick and started chasing Pete.
he got pretty fucking scared and started sprinting away from me.
he ended up running into the middle of an intersection and getting hit by a white SUV.
he was in the hospital for 3 weeks.
suffice it to say that he never hit me again.
