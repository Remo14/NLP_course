When I was little, around 8, I hated going to the dentist, he always made me uncomfortable for some reason.
I remember thinking his smile stretched too far and seemed forced, like clowns.
Anyway, my mom always came with me, and went back so I wouldn't be scared.
One day, my dad had me (divorced parents), and had to take me to the dentist, but tried to make me go back alone so he could sit out in the lobby doing whatever.
The assistants had to literally drag me back to the room and you could hear me screaming and crying down the hall, refusing to sit in the chair.
Finally, my dad came back to get me, irritated I'd made a scene, he rescheduled my appointment to when my mom would have me, and we just left, he made a big deal about how bad I was acting and told my mom she was spoiling me and all sorts of shit.
Two weeks later, it's on the news that my dentist was charged with child pornography, after molesting children under anesthesia and photographing it.
