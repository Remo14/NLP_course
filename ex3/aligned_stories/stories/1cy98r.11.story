PCP is an ongoing problem in my city.
It turns people into the incredible hulk in which nothing works in taking them down, more or less.
One time there was  a naked man in the middle of our bussiest street with a broadsword.
We literally had to circle him, and shoot him with pepper spray, rubber bullets, beanbag bullets and taser him at the same time to get him to drop the weapon.
On average it takes 6 officers to arrest one man on pcp if the man is angry.
This guy took about 10 police officers working together to arrest him.
I sat in my squad car and sipped coffee as i've had many incounters with pcp users and have my own battlescars.
