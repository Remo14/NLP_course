I was in class one day, sitting in a group of three people including myself.
We were talking and my friend dropped his pen on the desk.
I saw it stall in mid air for a second then drop on his desk.
My friend asked "Did anyone else see that?
" All my friends saw it, and it was just the weirdest thing I've ever seen.
To this day I have no explanation for it.
