I jumped in the middle of a fight to try and defend my friend.
I was the only one who got an assault charge.
Got forcibly taken to the hospital, against my wishes (I was fine.
) Had to put my life on hold while facing court cases, homelessness, and unable to find work instead of enlisting in the Air Force like I had planned on doing 2 days after this all happened.
Thanks to some asshat losing my paperwork, I am now STILL in this boat, facing a warrant for my arrest even though I never did anything truly wrong.
