I found a wallet outside of the busiest restaurant in town at 7am
A few people kept walking past it and I sat on a bench and watched as people just ignored it.
After 15 minutes I picked it up.
He had somebody else's credit card in there, many food stamps and a drivers license.
To put it bluntly, he looked like white trash.
I google mapped his location and found out he lived 4 towns away in what resembled a shed.
This sounded like the kind of guy who would give me a bag of coke for this back, so I didn't give it back.
I burnt it.
Go me.
