This'll get buried but:

I'm standing in line at the Apple Store getting a new phone case, and there's someone in front of me.
This person in front of me has god awful hair.
It has knots everywhere and there all these little bead things.
I stand there thinking "God, what an *ugly* woman this must be".
She turns around.
It's motherfucking Steven Tyler.
