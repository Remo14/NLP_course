So when I was like 11 or so I got really curious about sex and decided to try to simulate.
Being as innocent as I was i did not know what masturbation was much less how to do it properly and thought that sicking my dick in between a stuffed animals legs was good enough.
A few days later, after repeating my "experiment" several times, my penis began to turn red, swell up to about up to about 1.5 of its normal size an itch like a mothafucker.
I do not posses the skill with words to accurately describe how much my dick itched.
Every movement caused my pants leg to brush up against it causing it to itch only more.
My mother took me several doctors but none of them could tell my mother what was wrong with my penis (granted I never told them I routinely rubbed it against a stuffed animal).
Being the stupid kid I was I never made the connection between the inflammation of my dick and my unusual masturbation habits so once my penis returned to normal I resumed using stuffed animals as sex dolls which starting the whole thing all over again.
