When I was around 12 my mom had picked me up from soccer practice and we went home.
I sat down on the couch and started playing on my phone.
About 5 minutes later I got bored and went upstairs to my room.
10 minutes later I hear my name called by who I thought was my dad.
I walk downstairs to 4 cops in my house.
My mom had forgotten I was in the house and thought I was a robber.
When she heard someone run up the stairs she ran outside, yelled for help, and called the cops.
When they asked if anyone else was inside it dawned on her that the "robber" was me.
