Gave a beggar kid my own coffee and some biscuits in my pocket since it's illegal to give actual money to the poor.
In my country, they could be a part of a bigger gang using them for financial gains.
Since he looked hungry, I have my food (WHICH I HAVE JUST BOUGHT) and I gave it to him.
Bastard threw it rudely on the ground and said "Is this the best you can do?
Don't you have money".
I was open-mouthed, amazed.
