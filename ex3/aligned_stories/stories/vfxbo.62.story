When I was kid, I had a mean step mother and a stupid step sister.
Whenever I played any games with my step sister I would win and my step mother would accuse me of cheating.
She'd scream at me and sometimes hit me.
I finally realized one day that the only way to keep safe was to allow my step sister to win.
Once when we were playing Monopoly, I gave her some of my money when she was in the bathroom.
My step mother saw part of what I was doing but to her I was taking money.
Since she finally had proof that I was a cheater, the beating was extra special that night.
