Anyways, I told my mom to pull over immediately when we got to the first gas station.  I jump out of the car into the gas station, looked the clerk dead in the eye and asked where the bathrooms were, then he point to the back of the store.  I looked over for the toilet paper, but there was none there.  Then, like a sign from god I looked behind me, and up hung on the wall was a framed letter that read "If the bathroom fails to meet expectations, please notify management.  " I pulled this down, took the back off, and wiped my ass with the letter.
