She needed somewhere to live because she needed to serve a house arrest sentence and couldn't do it where she was currently located because everyone that lived there did drugs.  We weren't romantic or anything so i slept on the couch and gave her the room.  A few months go by and I realize she is a PIG.  She threw parties every night and never cleaned up.  We got evicted for noise complaint.
