I'm looking around and someone comes out and says "Oh yeah, I was bored so I went ahead and mowed it.." and I said "Oh.. ken paid me to mow it" and he says "Ahh, our secret man!  I didn't have the heart to take the money so I told him what happened and gave him back the 50 dollars.  "  "I gave you $100 dollars to mow the lawn!  Then he acts like "Well, if it's that important to you then you can just keep the extra 50, but I'm disappointed!!  I just had to swallow my pride and say "Well, I'm not giving you 50 extra dollars when I know for sure that you only gave me 50.
