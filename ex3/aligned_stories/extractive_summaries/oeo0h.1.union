When I was around 20, a few years ago, I kept having dreams about a woman with long black hair named Aroura [ pronounced A-roar-uh) .  I'm about to pull out and merge onto a highway when I get a phone call from a random number, so I stop the car but no one answered.  Second they get on the highway, some silver civic loses control of their wheel and crashes into the car that swerved in front of me.  Turns out the drivers of both cars died.  It 100% would of been me if I hadn't of got that phone call.  Called it back a few hours later out of gratitude and curiosity, rang 3 times and went to voicemail.  "Hi, you've reached aurora, please leave your name and number.  Some woman answers, we get to talking, I tell her my entire story including the dreams I had.
