One summer I was walking my dalmatian (Sweet Pea) and there was this Chihuahua loose and it ended up running into my grandmother (who was visiting for the summer).  A few weeks later I see the Chihuahua running loose but with another dog.  I couldn't catch them, but I saw her (Chihuahua -we call her Pee Pee) again a month later with a golden retriever and they ended up in our backyard.  After a few months we find the Pee Pee, the golden retriever, and this third dog I saw with her the first time one school morning.  So we call the owners at 7:15 AM to let them know their dogs are loose again and in our property to which the oldest daughter starts crying and begging me to "please why do you steal our dogs?  Please stop stealing our dogs!
