Well, it's kind of a funny story.. my first real "girlfriend" placed rules and regulations like it was an iTunes license agreement.. My friends and I have dubbed these, "The Chronicles of Kendra" (name NOT changed for safety because F her..)  When out in public, no public displays of affection.  We had to walk beside each other like we were brother and sister.
