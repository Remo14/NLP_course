We both pitched in on rolling a blunt, and smoked it on his couch until we both got pretty high.  Anyways, we were enjoying ourselves watching Star Wars on his t.v, when suddenly he pulls of his pants and starts masturbating in front of me.  He then proceeds to look me directly in the eyes, which creeped me the fuck out, and asked me to help him finish.  Somehow I managed to jolt to the left, allowing me to dodge the spray that eventually covered the door.  I realized I had forgotten my keys on the couch where the incident had begun.  Since it was close to -10F outside and my house was more than 20 miles away, I had no other option.  I spotted my keys lying on the edge of the couch, and made the poor choice of glancing at the door I had earlier tried to escape through.  I lunged to grab my keys, and just as I did, he appeared from behind the couch.
