Last night, I went to my boyfriend's for Halloween.  He's in student accommodation, and one of the girls on his floor has developed quite the desire for him.  She doesn't seem to consider my existence in all this, and quite simply, I wanted to show her that why yes, he does have a girlfriend.  So, even though everyone else was also free, I asked her to take a cute couple-y photo of us in our costumes.  To sorta.. drive home the point that he's mine.
