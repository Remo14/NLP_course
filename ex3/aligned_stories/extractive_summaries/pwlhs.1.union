I finally told my parents how long it had been since i had shit and they freaked out and took me to the hospital.  This next part is not a lie, but i know some of you will think it is, I got shit everywhere.  A janitor was only a few rooms down for some reason so I saw him go by to clean it, but he did not know who i was, he got to the bathroom and the whole ER heard, "Oh Hell no, I ain't cleaning this up.  I made some poor janitor quit his job over a shit-caked bathroom.
