I was an aspie, a tomboy, and my only good friends were for some reason extroverted fashionistas.  One was a guy...he'd been my video game buddy for years but when he came out of the closet, he transformed into a total douche that let me know DAILY that I looked like a lesbian hobo.  The other was a girl I had been best friends with since first grade, and she decided one day that I was holding her back with my apparent disregard for social norms.  On some AOL video game message boards, there was this girl.  Que Aspherger's syndrome:  My response to this was to make up some cool people to be my friends so that people would think I was cool, too.  I carried the facade into my real life.  They had families, hometowns, friends of their own.  A few had myspaces.  One friend from school even bitched about me to one of them...that's when I got jealous.  Also, at about this point, I fucked up bigtime and started "dating" one of them that "lived in Yorktown.  One by one, I literally wrote these people out of my life.  A couple of the fabrications who were old enough to enlist supposedly did that...I live in a navy area so that wasn't weird to anyone, either.
