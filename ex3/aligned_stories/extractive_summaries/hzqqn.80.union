When I was about 8 years old I went to a large indoor water park with my sister.  I'm sitting up and not going anywhere, basically half-way through the tube.  So I'm just sitting there basically dead in the water and I look back...there is my sister barreling down towards me.  At the last second, miraculously she swished around me and was gone.
