As the night goes on the flock of guys collides with a flock of girls from the same college and we all start to hang out together as one of the girls has been having a real hard time at home so we all thought that having a massive group of people, going to all the same places, for this girl we didn't know just to cheer her up would be an awesome idea.  Towards the end of the night our collective flock has gone down to just a few and one of the best guys I'd ever met was really getting into one of the girls as they're tucked away quietly into a corner.  We're all wondering WTF and decide to make sure she's ok and ask her what's wrong.  She then starts crying and screaming that my friend had given her drugs, oh boy.  The next day the police decide to check out the security tapes at the nightclub to see what they can see.  It turns out the VICTIM girl was the one that pulled out the drugs and from the looks of the video tried to slip my friend a couple of "somethings" into to his drink!
