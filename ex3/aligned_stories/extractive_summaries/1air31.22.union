I think I was around 18 years old, we'd been dating for about 8 months and I broke up with him because my parents were treating me differently and I didn't like it.  Broke up with him one night and about a week later he showed up at my parent's house wanting to talk to me.  He tossed me in the trunk and shut it and drove off.
