We were partying at a usual party spot by the river, and some dude came out of the woods.  He just kept saying weird shit like "you gotta watch yourself down here," "There are some bad folks around here" and when asked who he was he just said, "I'm nobody.  Later we found out the dude was just a guy that lived nearby and although a creepy drunk, he was harmless.  There was a fucked up, probably inbred family that lived up the road that he would warn people about.
