So my boyfriend and I just graduated, and were, naturally, receiving some cards in the mail.  Some with money, some without, whatever.  Anyways, my boyfriend has this grandpa who inherited a lot of money way back when and has since "invested" (lost) most of it in the stock market.  The family always rants about how he doesn't give a shit about them, and tries to milk him for money (he bought their two cars before he lost a lot of his money).  My boyfriend received a card from him with no money in it, laughed at the snarky message ("money is fleeting, knowledge is power"), and seemed happy enough.  A few days later, his mom is making a list of everyone who sent him cards.  When the grandpa comes up and she remembers he didn't send any money, she doesn't write his name down.  Apparently she planned to only send thank-you's to the people who sent cash.  She and her husband then proceeded to bitterly remark, with the biggest eye-rolls possible, that, since the grandpa had decided to help pay for my boyfriend's college education, they GUESSED that made up for it.
