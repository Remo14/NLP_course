One day a girl called to ask if I could email her pictures of one of our apartments because she was currently in a different city.  Her response was that I'd promised I would send her pictures that same day, also that I'd promised her she could lease the apartment over the phone, and that I was now discriminating against her by preventing her from renting that apartment.  She then asked to speak to my manager and shortly thereafter *faxed* over a written complaint about me and how horribly she had been misled and abused by me.
