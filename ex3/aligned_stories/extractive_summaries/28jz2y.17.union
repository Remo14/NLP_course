I recently posted a comment (no throwaway) about this girl I was into always talking to her ex-boyfriend and how it made me nervous.  I told her that doesn't change the way I feel about her ex-boyfriend and we pretty much went downhill from there.  Big argument erupted and we are no longer speaking.
