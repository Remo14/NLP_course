Back in high school,  I went to Wendy's with my (now ex-) girlfriend.  We had a few extra fries, so, being idiotic high schoolers, we decided we were going to throw them out the window while we were driving.  He said that the french fry left a huge dent in his car, obviously bullshit.  Anyway, the cops ask a couple questions, and I stupidly open the screen door for them, and they grab my girlfriend by the arm and start to handcuff her (for throwing a fry).  She eventually did get arrested and had to go to court against this asshole.
