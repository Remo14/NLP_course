Similar story to OPs, and comes by way of my friend, who was an X-ray tech at the time.  There are three perfect ovals in his bum.  They were hard-boiled eggs.  Later, she said, med personnel are talking about the weirdest things they've seen in the ER.  Turns out, they were at a restaurant and the girl crawls under the table to blow the guy.  She has a seizure and clamps down on his manhood, all while her head is bucking against the top of the table.
