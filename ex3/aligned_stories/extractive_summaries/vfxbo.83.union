One time, I was in Vegas and on the way back to my room I realized that I didn't have my phone!  I had my friend call it and some guy answered.  He said he was in the casino of our hotel so we went down to meet him.  I thanked him profusely and went on my merry way.  I was at a tennis tournament last summer and I got out of my seat to go get a refreshing beverage.  Some kid walked up to me as I was paying for my drink and handed me my phone which I didn't know had even been gone.  Oh no, I thanked the kid for being a good citizen.
