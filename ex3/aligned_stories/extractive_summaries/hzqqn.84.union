A few years ago, I was at a college house party.  I had to take a mean shit, so I went upstairs to the bathroom.  In a drunken stupor, I decided it would be funny to upper decker the toilet.  As I glanced around I noticed a robe hanging on the door.  I flipped it inside out and proceeded to wipe using the arm sleeves.
