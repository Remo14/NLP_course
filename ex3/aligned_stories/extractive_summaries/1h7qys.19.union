2 weeks later I arrived at the beach again after work.  A couple minutes later I heard a sound and so I turned to look at the water.  A mom was swimming into shore from a floating dock and her 5 or 6 year old was walking into the water out to meet her mom.  Her eyes bulged from her face as she turned around, lips trembling, then silently, without a yelp nor a peep, slipped underwater.  She was fine, albeit a bit scared.
