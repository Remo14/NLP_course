Sitting there hopeless and staring at my thermodynamics exam, my professor came up to me and gave me his calculator to use since I forgot mine.  I accidentally went back too far and saw values that the teacher must have punched in when he last used it, since it was his calculator.  However, I noticed that the number that my teacher put in matched a number in the last problem on the test.  I hit it again, another familiar value came up.  Using the calculator that MY TEACHER gave me, I worked the entire test backward using the memory of the calculator.  I got a 94%, missing one point on each page because I never listed the units in my answer (because I had no idea), and I set the curve.
