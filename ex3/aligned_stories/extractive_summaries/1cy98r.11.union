PCP is an ongoing problem in my city.  We literally had to circle him, and shoot him with pepper spray, rubber bullets, beanbag bullets and taser him at the same time to get him to drop the weapon.  On average it takes 6 officers to arrest one man on pcp if the man is angry.  This guy took about 10 police officers working together to arrest him.
