When I was around 7 or 8 years old I would have this really disturbing dream which would repeat night after night.  Anyway one night that this dream occurred, instead of immediately running I swung my fist at this spectral women.  This was the last night that this dream occurred.  I remember this dream being terrifying when I was younger and I like to think that the fact that I retaliated despite it having no effect meant that I faced my fears and refused to give in.
