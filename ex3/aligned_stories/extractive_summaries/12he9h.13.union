There's a bar at the end of my street, and my mom liked to go there to watch people play pool.  I got revenge there several times.  When I was in college, I was on a road trip and I saw a Canadian bar chain with the same name and logo.  I looked it up when I got home, and sure enough that bar chain had been in business for longer than the bar had been using that name and logo in the US.  So I emailed the chain with pictures of the bar and all the info for the bar.  They emailed me back to thank me and forwarded it to the legal department.
