I was bombed completely out of my mind on percocet after coming back from the surgery (I had awful wisdom teeth), and my mom basically just dropped me in bed and went and rented the movie for me because I'd never seen it in theaters.  A little bit after the black cat glich in the matrix scene, I passed out and apparently slept for about eight hours.  I woke up and the movie was at roughly the same spot as when I passed out, but it was completely dark outside.  Zero time lapse for me.  Started freaking out and screaming because I thought I'd discovered the secret and somebody turned off the sun.
