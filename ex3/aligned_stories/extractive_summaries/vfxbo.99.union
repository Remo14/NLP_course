Anyways, I take a leak, and on the way out notice a chick kind of huddled in a corner.  She was completely disoriented and really didn't know what was going on, who she was with, etc..  I used to work security at an all-girls dorm and I had seen girls come in that had been roofied, and that's what it looked like to me.  So I helped her up the stairs and said something to a group of waitress and bar tenders, and they literally just laughed in my face.  So, I go out to the cops and hoped they would help, and they were less resistant, but gave me the third degree about it, asking me if I was the one who drugged her, asking the girl if I had hurt her, all this crazy shit.
