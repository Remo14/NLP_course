I occasionally suffer from sleep paralysis.  It developed in my early twenties, and I've had the alien abduction dream.  It started with flashes of blue light, and I felt myself being lifted out of bed by the chest.  I was blinded by a white light, and I could hear a loud mechanical whirring.  The experience was the most intense sleep paralysis dream I've ever had.
