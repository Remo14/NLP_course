I had a friend lose his phone in Ottawa/Gitineau after a night of drinking.  Once he realized he had lost it we tried calling it.  Fortunately a Good Samaritan had found it and answered our call.  He said he would be happy to meet us and deliver the phone and my friend said he would buy Mr.  Unfortunately one of our group had a bit too much to drink and grabbed the phone from Mr. Lost Phone and starts creaming into it "You fucking thief!  When I find you I'm gone kick your ass.  Phone Finder is not pleased and replies "You can pick your phone up at the bottom of the Rideau Canal" and hangs up.
