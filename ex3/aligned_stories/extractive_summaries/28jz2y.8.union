A little after graduating High School, my ex-gf was killed in a car crash.  I was super torn up about it because I had a lot of feelings for her still even though she had gotten a new bf.  I posted a picture of her from a throwaway with the story of us and what happened to her in /r/pics.  I woke up the next day to the post on the front page and (for some reason) links to the post all over Facebook.  People I never had met or heard of were sharing the story and her picture all over social media, talking about me as if I was her true love.  It made me feel shitty because I wasn't trying to portray it that way out of respect for her poor current bf.
