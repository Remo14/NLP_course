It was low on battery (it was dead by the point she brought it home), so she picked it up and brought it home because she doesn't speak English that well.  I explained the situation to her, while she was trying to accuse me of stealing it.  She gets out of the car, grabs the phone, barks an angry "thanks" and gets back in the car and drives off.
