I went to go see Terminator Salvation when it was in theaters and had ridiculous gas the entire movie.  I decided that I was gonna clench and hold in all my farts and save them for a mega-fart during a quiet part.  So, during the last scene there was a quiet part to which I just let it rip.  So much pressure was built up that I ended up sharting my pants worse than ever before.  There was still about 15 minutes left so I decided I might as well just be a man and sit in my poo until the movie finished.  As soon as the credits came up, I ran to the bathroom.  Upon inspection I concluded that my boxers weren't salvageable so threw them in the toilet and tried to flush them down.  Upon walking out of the theater one of my friends pointed out that the shit had leaked through my underwear and there was a huge skid mark visible on the outside of my shorts.
