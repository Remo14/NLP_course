My dad told me this story once of how my grandpa knew a guy (I'll call him Bob) that used to work at Area 51.  Anyway, one night Bob and my grandpa are at a bar getting wasted and such and Bob starts talking about Area 51, which was a first.  He goes on about the creatures and aliens and ufos in there.  About the experiments and such.  And he doesn't show.  No one had after that night he went off about Area 51.
