We had two little kids at the time, one was still a baby, but my wife felt sorry for her and we took her in.  Now she didn't pay rent, didn't pay for food and we helped her get therapy and get her life straight.  Meanwhile the friend had called us, but since we were at the hospital all the time, we hadn't returned her calls.  Then we got an e-mail from her, saying she felt we were being distant and she was disappointed with us.  Next thing you know, we get all kinds of e-mail accusing us of being rotten friends and now that she was having a family of her own, she didn't have time in her life for people that weren't there for her.
