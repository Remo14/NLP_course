So one day, I notice that the silver paint is chipping off of my wheel caps, and I decide to be a (fake) man and DIY it by taking them off and spray painting them with a fresh coat of "fuck yeah" silver.  I took the caps, put them on a newspaper, painted them, and then set the whole package on the kitchen counter to dry.    Before I could finish, she exploded and started screaming at the top of her lungs about how she was almost convinced that they were "satanic ninja stars," and that she was about to kick me out of the house if I thought I was gonna come in here with that kind of satanic propaganda.
