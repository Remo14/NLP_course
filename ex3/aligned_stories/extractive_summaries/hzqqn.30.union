One day I went to the bathroom and took a shit.  There was no toilet paper.  I didn't know whose sock it was, all I knew was that I could wipe my ass with it, so I did.  I don't know why I did it, but I hid it behind the toilet.  Then my mom found the sock.  After the initial lecture my mom and stepdad apparently decided to go about the ordeal in a rational thinking kind of way.  It had been over an hour of parents yelling and they *still had not stopped laughing*.  No one knows.
