My brother's first wife wouldn't allow any of our family that she hadn't met into the wedding.  Now, we've got a good size-family, so this would mean things like inviting one cousin that she'd met, but not their parents or siblings that lived out of town, etc.  We offered to hold an engagement party so she could get to know some of our out-of-towners, but she declined, saying she didn't want to feel obligated to invite these new family members that she'd only met once and didn't know very well.  In the end, we decided to go with immediate family only, we figured it would be less awkward and rude than to pick-and-choose between family.  My brother ended up having 6 people at his wedding, along with around 65 from the bride's side.
