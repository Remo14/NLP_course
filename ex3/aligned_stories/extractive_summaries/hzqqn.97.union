One night when my friend was working, all of his friends took a bunch of mushrooms and ran through a park.  The next morning, my friend was eating breakfast and his roomate, one of the mushroom takers from the previous night, we'll call him Jim, came downstairs and told him a crazy story.  Supposedly he had gotten so high from the mushrooms that he had a dream he found a leprachaun and captured it.  Well, later that day Jim heard weird noises coming from his closet.  Inside the closet was a mentally challenged young boy, about 5 years old.  Aparantly the kid has downs syndrome and was reported missing the previous afternoon.  My friend and his roomate received a $1000 reward for safely returning the missing child to his family.
