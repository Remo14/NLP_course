As we are driving along this fairly deserted back road I began to zone out and I stare at this blinking red light off in the distance and casually think to myself "I wonder when they built a cell phone tower all the way out here.  " When suddenly it blinks and is dramatically closer than it was just a moment earlier, at this point my friend points it out and stops in the road.  It blinks once more and is directly in front and over top of us, the red light is so bright it floods the car in a deep scarlet hue.  I look out the window and to my horror the light is following us and does so for approximately 1-2 miles.
