All day I was self conscious that she could see the green peppers bulging out of my pants, but I knew I could fool her.  She came over to me at one point, kneeled down and said in a very reassuring voice 'Andy, did you hide your green peppers down your pants?  I was horrified.  I quickly reassured her that I didn't, and she quickly gave up and left me alone.  I thought to myself 'If I wear the exact same clothes tomorrow, maybe my pants will look exactly the same, and she will *know for sure* that there hadn't been anything in there the day before'.
