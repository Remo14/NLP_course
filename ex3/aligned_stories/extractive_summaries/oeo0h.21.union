My dad had this little toy monkey that he used to call his "favorite child" and tease me and my siblings with it.  Not in a bad way, but it was really frustrating to us and we spent hours trying to steal it from him.  Well anyways, one day we finally got it and threw it into the garbage after drawing on it and mangling it for a bit.  Anyways, a few years later (when I was about 17), I'm walking down the street in Toronto (I don't live in TO, was just visiting friends) and see this little orange object on the side of the road.  When I walk over to it, I pick it up and see that it was the EXACT SAME FUCKING MONKEY.  I honestly cannot even come up with the chances of that happening, especially considering our garbage is sent to a local dump and is nowhere near Toronto.
