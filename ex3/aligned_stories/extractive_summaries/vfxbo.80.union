When I was 15 I was working as a lifegaurd.  I see this 10 year old swimming along when a large 14 year old (nearly twice his size) jump right on top of him, knocking him out.  He was not breathing and had no pulse, so I start CPR.  During one of the chest compressions I hear a load crack.  I open the envelope to find his mother is suing me for injuring her son during CPR.
