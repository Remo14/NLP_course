After a while Kid Rock is like "hey man, wanna jam?  " and my friend says "Sure!  " and gives Kid his spare guitar.  He was playing his Father's priceless guitar; the same one John Denver played.  Kid Rock says to him, "Hey man, do you mind if I jam on a few by myself?  After about 10 minutes my friend hears a crash and looks at Kid Rock and sees that he threw his father's guitar OFF OF THE ROOF.
