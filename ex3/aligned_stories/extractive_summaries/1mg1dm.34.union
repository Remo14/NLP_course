I lit my cigarette and this guy asks me for a light.  We talk until we finish smoking, and he invites me into an expensive bar for a drink.  He buys me a $25 glass of cognac (only about 1/4-inch full), and introduces me to his wife and friend, some famous artist.  Turns out this guy is a mobster and rich as fuck.  I personally racked up a $1,200 bar-tab that night, all of which the mobster insisted in paying for.
