One night I was leaving my mums house from a visit, and it was "colder than a witches tit" as my dad would say ... somewhere around -30, plus some wind.  So I'm driving back to my place when I see a girl, late teens early 20s, walking down the road in an un-sensible outfit... knee length skirt, runners, sweatshirt, no hat, gloves, coat.  On a whim I pulled up beside her and said "its fucking cold, can I give you a ride somewhere .. you shouldn't be out walking in this weather".  " .. me, still stupid "well, I go to parties, but the picking up isn't really a strong point *laugh*".  She says "well, you can always pick up with me" and proceeds to reach her hand over and put it on my thigh, then she says "for $100 I can keep going".  I laughed and brushed her hand aside by claiming I had to shift, and said thanks but no.  After a quick gulp, I asked her how much further until we got where she needed to go.  It was just ahead so I pulled in .. she climbed out of the car and said "last chance", turned around, lifted up her skirt and showed me her bare ass.  I immediately called my mother and, laughing hard, said " I just accidently picked up a hooker!".
