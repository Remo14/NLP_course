I was cashing out a client who came into the salon with her mother.  When I came back to the register to cash them out, there were two Asian ladies in front of me.  Since they were the only two people at the register, I assumed they were the duo I was supposed to cash out.  " The younger lady went into a rage, cursing me out for being racist and assuming all Asians looked the same.
