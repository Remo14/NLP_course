I had him send in his resume to my boss and he got the job.  2) Stay with us rent free for like 2 months while he got on his feet  We sign a new lease with a new townhouse (he didnt sign it, stupid stupid me) and we moved in.  From that point on, he refused to help with ANYTHING at the house stating "I didn't make the mess so I am not going to help.  So, instead of trying to return the favor of me helping him out, he decides to just up and move out to a new apartment on the other side of the city.  A month or two later just quits his job at the place I got him work with nearly no notice and just bailed on us all.
