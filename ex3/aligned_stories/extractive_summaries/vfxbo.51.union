As im going by her looking infront of me i see this white thing in the road that i think is just snow.  as im going over it, it turns and looks at me and its a fucking little dog all white.  i go over it.  i walk over to check on the dog which is visibly shaken but not injured short of a small bleeding scratch on its head probably from a hangar that was holding my muffler on.  The owner shows up after a few minutes and the lady who was stopped in the left lane comes out of her car.  I look at the owner and apologize then give the owner a blanket from my car to put the dog in to get it off the street and warm it up and my business card and offer him a ride home.  Ladys boyfriend was also cool and thought it was somewhat sad situation nothing bad really happened dog was alright just scared shitless as i bet i would have been if i was him also lol.
