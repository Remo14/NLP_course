My girlfriend told me the week before I went to college that I got her pregnant knowing that we were not going to date long distance.  She sent me a picture of a stock photo pregnancy test she cropped that was positive I literally just Google searched "Positive Pregnancy Tests" and it was one of the first ones.  I made her come over and take another one.  It was negative, she left.
