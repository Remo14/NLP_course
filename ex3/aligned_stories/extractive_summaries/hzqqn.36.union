There's has been multiple free servers and there was one server which I played on it constantly and then one day, i was really bored and I decided to make a girl account.  At first, few days as it went wasn't so bad then people started to hit on me left and right.  I decided to make up an identity behind the girl characters, I was known as Jeanette "Janie" Southsworth to the players.  YOU R SO HAWT!  I FAPPED!  That was when I knew I just had to stop but there was a fanbase based on Janie so I started to pretend that Janie was too busy to focus on the game, too much schoolwork, have to take care of her new twin sisters named Bella and Eliza, then I gradually made her have to ditch the game to focus on her schoolwork so she can go to a college.
