Was driving from Atlanta GA to Lexington SC with my GF to visit my parents.  I like to drive at night since there are less people on the road and I can take my time.  At around 3am or so we are making good time.  In the distance I can make out what looks like a hitch hiker, or what I think is one, but can't really tell due to such low light.  As I get closer I start to notice other things, like how the person is kinda thin and tall and completly, for the most part, apparently brown.  This was no person.  And it is the most terrifying thing I have ever seen in my life.
