I descided I woud skip the gym for a change and tidy up.  I spent all morning cleaning out the fridge, mopping, cleaning up the closet... the whole nine yards.  Then he asked me how the gym went.  I told him oviously enough I did not go.  He looked at me with disgust and asked me if I had looked in a mirror lateley and if I knew how fat I was.
