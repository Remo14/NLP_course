I dont know if this is "great", but I was sent to a disciplinary school in first grade, and before I was actually sent there I was taken to a psych ward to be "evaluated".  I scream, start bawling hystericly, and run full force at those doors.  So, the guy not down, I took a flying leap towards his face.  Then he took me to a room and out me in a strait-jacket sort of thing, only I was on the floor and couldn't get up.  I remember thrashing around in it for an hour, then finally feeling my whole finger go through one of the Velcro straps, only for them to come over and readjust the whole thing.  That was more time in the jacket, then I had to share a bed with some girl who had apparently never learned to control her bladder.
