The most significant first incident was seeing my dead grandfather.  Mom breaks out in tears, pulls me into a hug.. and explains that she saw her father (my dead grandfather) come into her room, sit on her bed and tell her it was all going to be okay.  I only met her once in person, but shortly after meeting her she appeared in my dreams.  Every night, for YEARS.
