As a youngling, (somewhere Kindergarten or 1st grade) I attended a rather large easter-egg hunt.  I spot one in a tree and climb my little ass up there to retrieve it.  When I get down and crack it, the prize is a fucking remote control plane.  *YES YES YES* I think, and say, as I run over to turn it in.  As I hand the lady the slip, she tells me "this is a big kids toy, I can't give it to you", and she gives the plane to her son.
