One school day, a boy named Tom was sitting in class and doing math.  His desk was next to the window, and he turned and looked to the grass outside.  It looked like a picture.  She was so beautiful he wanted to meet her, so he ran all over the school and asked everyone if they knew her or have ever seen her before.  But everyone he asked said "No.  In the middle of the night Tom was awakened by a tap on his window.  He saw a shadow near his window, so he got out of his bed, walked toward his window, opened it up and followed the giggling.  He walked across the road, when suddenly he got hit by a car.
