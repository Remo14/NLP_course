My friend got attacked by a group of 8 black men in their early 20s.  And while one of them is looking into the wallet that I had opened, showing them, one of the men punched me in the face.  They all took off in a van after that without getting anything out of me or my two friends.  As we were calming down, we noticed that my friend's car was gone.  The friend that was first attacked that I came out of hiding for.  Not only did he leave us while we stepped in to help him, he went to Taco Bell to get a drink of water.
