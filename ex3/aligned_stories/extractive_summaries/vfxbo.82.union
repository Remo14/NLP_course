Struggling hard in med school being on call (fall 2000), I decided to do some quick shopping and grab a bite to eat.  My bro comes with.  I'M buying some thing from an electronic store, checking out... Then ... Can't find him.  Wait around... Getting pissed.  Finally I see him and just...  Unload on him.  "where the F___ were you?  I'm so tired why would you waste my time!?  " Scream at him all the way to the car.  We get in, and he pulls out "Arcanum", a video game I was wanting.  Thought I'd surprise you with this when you got home.  I cried for a good 30 minutes.  Still feel like crying just writing the story.
