We got bored and decided we were going to put up a lemonade stand.  Only one problem - we couldn't find the sugar.  She makes the first pitcher with the stuff on the counter.  She told her we used the stuff of the counter like she said - the sugar that was in the plastic baggie.  She starts laughing at us and says that was laundry detergent.
