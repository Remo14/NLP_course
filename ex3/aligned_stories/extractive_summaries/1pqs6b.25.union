I used to be an Over the road truck driver delivering to dollar stores all around the northeast United states.  I was cruising around 50 MPH or so, since there were no cars, and the road was wide open.  So I'm chugging along fully loaded on my way to the first store when I see what looked like a small bump, no big deal.  As I get closer I realize exactly how big this bump is and the fact that in reality it's a raised railroad track.  By this time, I was way too damn close to slow down at all.  I swear to god when it was all said and done I managed to get at least 5 feet of air in that thing.
