As you probably remember, around that time there was the whole controversy over the "Ground Zero mosque".  That anti-Islamic British group (name escaping me at the moment) was there, handing out their literature right in front of the hotel.  I saw two clergymen talking with a TV reporter nearby about how the mosque project was painful for the 9/11 families and disrespectful to the victims, crap like that.  I started debating them on the merits of the mosque project.
