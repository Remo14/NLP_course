I was eating popcorn in front of the TV and dropped a piece.  My mom was a stickler about messes, so I looked all over, under the couch, under the TV stand, everywhere, and couldn't find that popcorn.  I look down, and right between my feet, is a freshly popped kernel of popcorn.  I'd been sitting there for at least an hour, and there was nobody else in the room.
