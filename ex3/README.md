### NLP FINAL ASSIGNMENT ###

To run the code in this folder, run ex3.py
which generates two .tsv files in the folder results
corresponding to the summarisation of two different datasets:

a. Daily Mail Stories Tokenized

b. Aligned Summarization Data

with their respective Rouge2 and RougeL scores
using two different summarization models:

a. LEAD-2

b. TF-IDF

The results are compared qualitatively
by diagnosing the main differences between the two files
and the scores for the two models.

The reference summaries correspond to the highlights in the Daily Mail Stories
and to annotator d's Extractive Union summaries in the Aligned Summarization Data.
